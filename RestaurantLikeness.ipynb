Consistently, it impresses with its impeccable service and, most importantly, its delectable food.\\n\\nHowever, be prepared for potentially lengthy wait times, as the old-school method of adding your name to the waitlist might slow things down. They jot down your name, hand you a ticket, and you wait nearby until they call your name or number--a bit inconvenient, but worth it for the experience.\\n\\nNow, onto the food--where do I even begin? For me, the fried rice is a non-negotiable. I'm always left wondering about their secret ingredient because it never fails to amaze me!\\n\\nOf course, Joe's Shanghai is renowned for its steamed dumplings, and you absolutely must try them. With a variety of filling options, there's something for everyone to enjoy.\\n\\nHonestly, anything you order here is bound to be amazing. So, don't hesitate to stop by, even if there's a line--it's worth the wait! Soup dumplings are always a go to - big, delicious soup, and great temperature.\\n\\nWe also got the seafood pan fried noodles, that gets a 1-2 stars ( so this averages to 3). The noddles had a weird flowery aftertaste. Also the seafood that came with it was:\\n- 1 squid part\\n- 2 shrimps\\n- 1 scallop\\nAnd some light vegetables. Do not get this here. It was bland and lacking in every area! This was my third time here. In the past the food has been phenomenal hence why I've came back. But this time, it wasn't great. The fried rice and scallion pancakes were just as good as I remember.\\n\\nHowever, the soup dumplings (ordered both crabmeat and pork combo and pork soup dumplings) had hard bits of chewy meat. The overall soup component was not very flavorful and required a lot of vinegar, spice, and soy sauce.\\n\\nThe crispy shredded beef was good but not great- again, lacking flavor dimension.\\n\\nThe staff is always so nice here & honest about their recommendations on what to order. Food always comes out in a timely manner. It's always really busy so make sure you come and expect a bit of a wait! Fun, random spot in Chinatown for lunch. A coworker suggested it and to get there early. We were seated promptly but the line was out the door in just minutes. I am not a big Asian foodie but have to say it was a great meal experience. Beef+broccoli was outstanding as was the dumplings. Though I am not the best judge, the whole vibe felt authentic. Well done. 5 star experience. 4 star due to 18% service charge for 3 guests This was the first places I've dined in NYC where i said to myself... i can cook better than this. I ordered the Shanghai stir fried noodles (with chicken). It was in much need of seasoning, and - can you believe - it cost $21.50 (tax and tip included). The noodles weren't bad but they weren't anything special either, and the lack of ingredients made it less palatable since it was eventually just noodles and chicken pieces.\\n\\nGiven we were a group of 10, I appreciate that they allowed us to have separate checks. (we all got separate things so that must have also made it easier). But gosh I can't wait to go home and make my own stir fried/lo mein.\\n\\nTo top it all off, I took a look around the restaurant and there were very few Asian diners, if that tells you anything. overall 4 stars- it was four of us and came here on a Saturday night. It's not a fancy place, most people were dressed down.\\n\\nWhat I can say it appears ALWAYS busy.\\n\\nPROs- AWESOME FOOD which I would give a 5 Star rating, good size portions, fair prices, great menu, bathrooms were clean, it was comfortable and the room temperature was good.\\n\\nCON's-The 18% SERVICE CHARGE??? not Cool....many other Yelpers commented on this charge. When I get great service I tip well. In this case the bill was $160 before tax and service charge. We did add a tip on top although this really bothered us. It's bad enough they are CASH ONLY. For a part of 4 be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for a table of 4 on a Saturday night.\\n\\nThe service was ok, the waiter was very nice although he was not proactive to ask or make any recommendations. He kept the water glasses full. We were there for about 90 minutes and when we were done and paid the bill I did not like being asked to leave because another set of customers waiting.. We were there about 90 minutes and we did not argue the point as they were busy. My overall rating for the pros was a 3.\\n\\nOverall I would recommend them although you need to set the expectations before you go there. Have you even eaten in New York if you haven't eaten at a Joe's something??? It's classic. And Joe's Shanghai is no different.\\n\\nIt's on the edge of Chinatown, walkable from the metro station. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and has a more modern vibe to it.\\n\\nMy friend and I came in on a weekday afternoon (2pm) and it was still busy. We waited about 10 minutes for a table and the service was prompt and super speedy.\\n\\nWe ordered the pork soup dumplings, the string beans with minced pork, fried rice cake with beef, and crispy pork chop.\\n\\nXLB: 9/10 this is my 3rd time coming here and I feel like the dumplings just keep getting bigger and bigger. The skin is on the thicker side and it's filled super full of soup and pork. They taste amazing, but minus one point bc I'm a thin wrapper girly\\n\\nString beans: 10/10 perfectly cooked, not too mushy and not too crispy. Has that perfect crunch without being raw. Also perfectly flavored. Definitely a veggie dish though. The \\\"with minced pork\\\" means it has a small topping of pork. But super super yummy. Will always get this when I come here.\\n\\nFried rice cake with beef: 9/10 chewy rice cakes with huge chunks of tender beef. Yummy, but not as flavorful as some of the other dishes.\\n\\nCrispy pork chop: 8/10 pork is tender and juicy and the fried outside is crispy. It's flavored really well and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it adds the perfect extra flavor. I just wish the pork to batter ratio was a little better, batter can be a bit on the thicker side.\\n\\nOverall, amazing place with quality food. Definitely a classic. Add this to your list of \\\"Joe something's\\\" that you've been to I came with a friend for saturday dinner at 7:30pm and it was super busy. We waited probably 30 mins before getting seated and they asked if we would be willing to share a table with others, which we agreed to, but if you don't want to do this, the wait would've been longer. Additionally, usually when I've had to do this at restaurants I would share like those long rectangle tables where you're never actually sitting directly in front of people you don't know but here we shared a round table with a lazy susan, so it was a little awkward lol but my friend and I still enjoyed our dinner!\\n\\nWe ordered the pork xiaolongbao, shanghai noodles, and spicy szechuan style sliced beef. The pork xiaolongbao were huge and could barely fit in our spoons but were delicious. The spicy szechuan beef was pretty good too - very saucy and a little sour. I thought the shanghai noodles were not bad but nothing special - a little bit on the blander side so I would probably opt for something else if I came back. Overall, my friend and I had a good time and would recommend trying esp the xiaolongbao! Queue was quite long on rainy days when we got there.\\nThe waitlist system is super outdated, there is no enough room for people who wait to be called.\\nI was given ticket with number.\\nRestaurant was packed at the time I came as it was during lunch time.\\nDumpling choice surprisingly only fews, mostly menus are a la carte with many options of different protein.\\nThe pancake was tasty and Dumpling was delicious.\\nTo note this restaurant only accepts CASH payment and the gratuity has already included in the bill.\\nThe price, is slightly higher compared to restaurants in the area. This restaurant is extremely popular. I wasn't expecting such a long line out the door, but it moved fairly quickly. They are best known for their soup dumplings. I'd never had them before. These steamed dumplings are filled with pork and broth. They serve large portions. I also tried the chive pancakes, which were simple but delicious. I highly recommend the General Tso's Chicken - perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Their menu selection is extensive, so I am certain you will find something you enjoy.\\n\\nOverall - high 3 My NYC friend really likes this place for xiaolongbao/soup dumplings! I think he overhyped it a little, it still tastes great tho! The dumpling skins were a little thinner than other places. The food came out SO fast though!\\n\\nWe also ordered family style but it's not picture:\\n- Beef fried rice -- I don't recommend, but another friend really wanted it\\n- Pork Belly with pickled veggies -- thought it was decent, def overpriced\\n- Chili Fish -- do recommend but on the pricier side. Not too spicy honestly.\\n\\nWe spent $140 included tip (CASH ONLY) for 6 people. This was my first time having authentic Xiao Long Baos (soup dumplings), and it was an absolute delight.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly suggest giving their soup dumplings a try, as they steal the spotlight at this restaurant.\\n\\nOur table opted for both the pork and crab soup dumplings; while most of us favored the pork, I found both equally enjoyable. The crab soup dumpling packs a strong crab flavor punch, which might be a bit intense for some palates.\\n\\nService was just okay - the place was packed and chaotic. Definitely not the spot for a peaceful dinner! Hot, tasty, OG dumplings.\\n\\nOrdered (2) servings of the pork dumplings and scallion pancakes.\\n\\nBunch of sake too. Finally glad I went here. Service is very fast and ambiance is like a nice Chinatown restaurant. I took my family here because we saw this restaurant trending on Yelp, and it did not disappoint! There was no wait whatsoever, and it was not that busy. We looked at yelp for some popular dishes and we asked the waiter for some recommendations and we came up with a list of food that we wanted to try. Pork Meat Soup dumplings were really good! This restaurant is famous for them so I'm glad it was really delicious! The warm soup inside the dumpling was warm, unique and tested very well. Sesame Chicken blended well with the rice and was my favorite out of the dishes I had at this restaurant. The Shrimp Fried Rice and Pan Friend Noodles were exactly what you expect from a restaurant. It was good but I don't think anything stood out for the rice and noodles.\\n\\nOverall i would give this a 5 star because I had a really good experience. Would want to go back not only to try more food but also eat some of the crowd favorites. Probably the worst Shanghainese food I've ever had. I was never impressed back in its original location but I don't remember it ever tasting this bad.\\n\\nOily, bland and tasteless. No name dumps without the recognition JS has tastes better. Being a soup dumpling fan, read Joe's Shanghai's positive reviews and decided to check it out with a friend, new to them. Ordered the Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings (a.k.a. Xiao Long Baos) which were extremely big. That being said, their huge size, the inadequately sized spoon and lack of bowl to eat them over made them difficult and sloppy to get down. The flavor also did not match those of the recently closed former Grand Sichuan on W 24th & 9th - where their's was one of my favorites.\\n\\nWe also ordered half a Peking duck, which was served with half the boneless meat with skin on one plate, the boned meat on another, a small saucer of sauce, four pancakes to wrap, plus a plate of scallion and cucumbers. The slices on the boneless plate were more skin and fat than meat. The boned meat place required a lot of work. More importantly the sauce and pancakes were inadequate given the level of meat. It required about 6-8 pancakes for the half and a larger bowl with sauce. Paying for any extra pancakes, given the level of duck, seems not right given the price.\\n\\nIf you're longing for soup dumplings, there has to be better places out there in NYC.\\n\\nALERT! - Be aware of the automatic \\\"Service Fee\\\" they add to your bill - even for parties of 2 - if you don't want to double tip! Look, the hype is real and it's valid\\n\\nThe soup dumplings here are so legit. We got two orders of pork and they came out piping hot, with an entire spoon of soup per each one and sooo flavorful. Savory with a slightly sweet broth\\n\\nWe also got the eggplant with garlic and pork $17 and szechuan beef noodle soup $14\\nAnd a bowl of rice $3\\n\\nThis place is cash only and they auto add on gratuity\\n\\nThe eggplant was so delicious but kinda a small portion for the price. The soup is a great deal and a huge bowl\\nWe didn't finish the soup so ended up taking just about the whole thing with us\\n\\nIf you came here years ago, they've undergone a whole renovation and the place looks entirely different\\n\\nOn a Tuesday around 1p, wait was around 5-10 mins Yum, yum! This place is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious; we definitely gained some weight from this visit.\\n\\nWe were apparently very lucky to have been seated immediately, because when we left the line to get in filled the entire sidewalk. It's not hard to see why. With large tables that cater to the entire family, it's the perfect way to get together for lunch or dinner. Plus, like I said the food was tremendous!\\n\\nDo not skip out on the soup dumplings!\\n\\nWe had two waiters who were very attentive to our needs, and were extremely friendly. The entire staff were polite and balanced all the guests with ease. Highly recommended Joe's Shanghai Lunch time, party of 2....no wait! I checked reviews before and saw that it was a cash only establishment. They do have atm's up front....and if you are worried about a service charge, it is probably time to change your bank.\\n\\nWe picked the crab meat and pork soup dumplings and then asked the server for a recommendation. He pointed out the crispy shredded beef.\\n\\nThe dumplings arrived first and they were sooooooo good. It's hard to wait for them to cool down, but that broth can be painful if you start in too quickly. The filling was delicious and the broth was rich and delicious. I was surprised by the crispy shredded beef. It was completely different than I had imagined. It seemed similar to orange chicken, but with strips of beef. It was sweet and crispy and paired well with the white rice. This was a lot of food for a party of 2....sadly we couldn't take it with us, so we made sure to finish the dumplings.\\n\\nThis place is busy, lots of tables but everything seemed to come out quickly. Joe's Shanghai I had HIGH expectations for only because of how crowded this place was. When we arrived it was about a 10-15 minute wait for a party of two. Of course when you see every table order something you are going to see why, so we ordered two popular items, the soup dumplings and the Peking duck. We also tried the spicy beef noodle soup, not sure if it's popular but it was definitely oily and made my gf a bit sick.\\n\\nThe soup dumplings we got the pork and crab one but we weren't really a fan because the dipping sauce wasn't spicy and it was too overwhelming crabby. But it does taste like when you open a blue crab and slurp it. I think it was just missing sriracha or a spicier hot oil sauce. I didn't think their vinegar sauce did it for me.\\n\\nThe Peking duck saves the review. We got a half order and it took 40 mins to prepare. The duck was very tasty and the skin was crunchy so when you wrap everything altogether it made for an immaculate bite. Having heard so much about Joe's Shanghai I had to try their Soup Dumplings! I arrived on a Tuesday at 1:30pm and unsurprisingly there was a huge crowd of people waiting outside. I stepped inside to get a ticket (don't lose this!) from the lady and that was when the true test of patience began. Since I was by myself, I was told that the wait would be about 30 min which turned into an hour. Pretty long if you ask me for a single person, but clearly there were many larger parties in front of me who had already been waiting just as long if not longer.\\n\\nOnce seated, I already knew I only wanted one thing: the Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings (XLB)! While waiting, I got a chance to see the interior which was modern and very clean. As soon as the XLB arrived I could feel all of my excitement as my mouth drooled in anticipation. Upon opening the bamboo lid, a huge plume of steam escaped revealing 8 of the largest soup dumplings I have ever seen! Somehow these delicate pouches of joy were able to hold all of the delicious and fatty pork broth that completely coats the inside of your mouth. The crab/pork filling was very meaty and tasty while the skin was thin. The top was a bit too chewy, but overall a very satisfying XLB.\\n\\nOverall, the XLB is top notch and is quite comparable to what I have had here in the Bay Area for those who have had Din Ding Dumpling House. I'd say Joe's Shanghai is slightly larger and fattier so you definitely get more bang for your buck. Only downside is that it is cash only. I don't think I'd wait here again by myself, but would certainly be willing to come back with a group of friends to try more things as a group. Cash only.\\n\\nTheir xlb are a lot bigger than the typical xlb. Tasty & always hits the spot. Would prefer a sweeter & more umami filling but these will do.\\n\\nPlace was packed so I don't be annoyed if you have to share a table. This review is based solely on the experience and service I did not receive. I picked this place based on the good Yelp reviews. We walked in and were seated right away. After waiting for about 10 minutes and having not received a menu, I attempted to get the attention two of the older male employees, a couple of different times, they both looked my way and totally disregarded my attempts to ask for assistance. Two other parties, who arrived after me, were seated, received service and starter food and I had yet to receive a menu or acknowledgment.\\n\\nI left this, cash only, restaurant very disappointed with the service and not being able to try the food I'd read about on Yelp. TASTY soup dumplings!! Their xlb is on the thicker/bigger side but so so delicious!! We got takeout but the restaurant looks super cute inside and always bustling! My friends and I always made it a point to go to Joe's Shanghai every time we come to NY. However, this time it felt and tasted a bit different. The xlb didn't come piping hot, and when biting into it the broth and meat felt lukewarm. It felt greasy eating the xlb and was not as enjoyable as I remembered it to be. The stir fried rice cakes and udon were ok, it tasted like they used the same sauce and toppings for both of the dishes. We all agreed that the quality of the food seems to have gone down a bit. Overhyped Shanghainese fair.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was certainly edible. But after all we had heard and see with the piles of people outside, my friends and I thought we would have experienced more here.\\n\\nSeating was fast and service was great, but the food was the star letdown. Everything we ordered was best described as mid. The scallion pancakes though, may have been the least \\\"scallion\\\"-filled I have ever had. Ever the pork soup dumplings had very little soup or unique flavor.\\n\\nStrangely, despite our party of five, we were initially only given four duck skins for our roasted duck. We had to ask for a fifth since it would have been unreasonable to \\\"split\\\" a wrapper. We're thankful the staff were kind enough to offer an additional wrapper, but found it strange that it was standard to not include it. We would have been OK paying for extra if we had more people or if we had ordered more duck. But to expect us to wrap a WHOLE duck in just four skins is a bit too much. Yummy food. The soup dumplings were so good! However wish they had a bigger variety. We had the pork soup dumplings and the crab soup dumpling and both great!! The Singapore noodles were good as well. The sesame chicken was actually a favorite!\\n\\nThe service was meh. Very crowded and overwhelming. Not some place to come for a quiet dinner! Our glasses were very dirty but it seemed that was normal. Came out to Joe's Shanghai on thanksgiving day and the wait wasn't bad. Just needed to grab a red ticket and make sure that the whole party is here in order to be seated.\\n\\nWe got 4 pork soup dumplings and 1 Shanghai style noodles for 4 adults and 1 kid. It was enough to fill us! Everything was flavorful and I enjoyed the texture of the noodles. The environment and staff were nice and welcoming. During our trip to NYC, Joe's showed up repeatedly on our search for must-have restaurants. Needless to say we made a point to make a trip to see what the hype was all about.\\n\\nTotally overrated, totally overhyped, and total disappointment.\\n\\nTo start, the popular soup dumplings. I don't think I've ever been so repulsed by a food item. I've had soup dumplings before, and these were absolutely horrible. Soup was bland. Also, there was so much fat in the soup. It looked disgusting and I couldn't eat them. The amount of fat floating in the soup was repulsive. I cannot even begin to describe how bad it was. It kind of set the tone for the rest of the visit as I was scared to try anything else.\\n\\nI ordered the Shanghai fried rice. The pics I saw showed a tastier looking version. When we got ours, it was a very bland dish. It was just white rice with eggs and onions in it. No sauce, no flavors. Disappointed again.\\n\\nThen we had the crispy noodles with beef. Another popular item. The crispy noodles were ok. The beef wasn't horrible but something about the sauce was very off.\\n\\nOverall, I can't recommend this place. Don't do it. We were supposed to come a few years back but never made it. So, being in the city recently, we decided to fix history and finally pay a visit.\\n\\nGlad we made the trip! We came on the earlier side of dinnertime on a weekday, so there was no wait for a table. The ambiance was nice, very open with light and airy decor. They give you free tea too!\\n\\nThis place is famous for the soup dumplings, but couldn't partake because I don't eat meat. We went with the veggie dumplings instead, and they were excellent. They came in the steamer dish, and were perfectly formed and heaping with veggies.\\n\\nI got the jumbo prawns in citrus sauce and they were delicious. Perfectly crispy, with a thick, sweet sauce. You could really taste the citrus and I think there was even a bit of fresh peel in there.\\n\\nMy partner got the fried rice and enjoyed it.\\n\\nService was excellent. The waiters work as a team, so there's always someone nearby to clear your plates or refill your water glass.\\n\\nThey accept cash only (perhaps Venmo too?), and there is already a gratuity on the bill.\\n\\nIf you are in the city, for sure give this place a try! Some people may think that this place is overrated but I couldn't disagree more. The soup dumplings were the best I have ever had. We also ordered two rounds of their canned sake to celebrate getting seated without a wait! The key was to go before noon. We were a party of 5 too so I was shocked. The place was busy but not busy enough yet where we had to wait looks like.\\n\\nThe soup dumplings were the perfect amount of flavor and texture. I wanted to drink up all the soup to savor it. We also ordered some green beans which were so yum. We also liked the soup dumplings so much that we ordered another round of them of course.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back again when I'm in New York and try more of their menu! Visiting Joe's Shanghai is like a rite of passage for Xiao Long Bao lovers. Known as the trailblazer that introduced this exquisite dish to the American palate, my expectations were sky-high. The restaurant, bustling and more spacious than its previous incarnation, operates with a precision that's almost military in its efficiency.\\n\\nAfter a 40-minute wait, which felt like a small test of patience, I was ushered to my table. The main event: Xiao Long Bao. And oh, did they live up to their reputation. Each dumpling was a parcel of joy, bursting with flavors that evoked a sense of happiness and warmth. These dumplings were crafted to perfection - no unfortunate leaks, no unnecessary dough - just pure, steaming deliciousness.\\n\\nIn a bid to expand the culinary journey, we also ordered the roast duck. While flavorful, it missed the mark on the anticipated crispiness, leaving a bit more to be desired. However, this slight detour didn't dampen the overall experience.\\n\\nLeaving Joe's Shanghai, I was filled with a sense of culinary fulfillment. It was a reminder of why this place has earned its stripes in the Xiao Long Bao hall of fame. A definite must-visit for anyone seeking to explore the roots of this beloved dish in the States. This was our very first meal on our trip to New York and after a short wait (because we were willing to share a table), we were treated to a feast of classic Shanghainese dishes. Although very popular and well known, we found that the food was too oily and other than their signature dishes, there was something left to be desired.\\nThe dishes we ordered included:\\n\\nXiao Long Bao - their most famous dish and for good reason. Thin skin, filled with soup and meat that was not too fatty but flavourful.\\n\\nPotstickers - very good as well, nice skin and tasty meat filling.\\n\\nHouse Special Glazed Crispy Chicken - thinking that it would be a half chicken cut up we were surprised to see golden glazed chicken chunks that were battered and fried similar to sweet and sour pork. Served with broccoli, we were so surprised to love this dish. With white meat chunks that were not over battered in a perfectly sweet and tangy sauce, we finished the whole dish!\\n\\nShanghai Fried Noodles with Pork - This was a nice sized portion of noodles that were stir fried with some veggies and pork strips but there was way too much oil.\\n\\nBok Choy with Mushrooms - wanting a veggie dish, we went with this classic. Nothing wrong but the sauce was too gloopy for me.\\n\\nLions head Meatballs - the least favourite dish of the night, we couldn't even finish it because although the portion was very large, the meat itself was not very good either being overworked or mixed to flour and much too fatty. Similar to the above, sauce was too gloopy.\\n\\nOverall, I had high expectations for Joes Shanghai and was quite disappointed with the dishes that were not their \\\"classics\\\". For somewhere so popular I would have expected to be blown away but left feeling uncomfortably stuffed. Let me start off by mentioning I am a huge dumpling fan. I had been dying to try Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings and literally waited in the rain to be seated. The line is long, expect that.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty big and they do a good job of packing everyone in. It did take a while for us to be waited on however.\\n\\nThe crab and pork soup dumplings were a nice size and the flavor was pretty good but the texture wasn't the best I've had. There was something missing from the broth so I can say I've had better dumplings.\\n\\nThe scallion pancake was very greasy, and don't get me wrong I love a bit of grease, but the oil on these overpowered the doughy-ness I normally love.. Again I've had better.\\n\\nThe crispy fried beef was a nice shareable serving but it was unexpectedly sweet and while the first few bites were good the sticky sweetness completely overpowered the dish.\\n\\nMy main issue with Joe's is not the food, it was the lack of cleanliness. The menus were dirty the place itself felt a little run down and the major thing for me was the vinegar and chili oil serving dishes were dirty and seemed to not be changed out.\\n\\nI had heard so much about this place and was a little disappointed that it wasn't what I expected but I might be back to give it another try. Came here hoping to get lunch but the wait was extremely long. We opted to get takeout and eat it outside instead. It took us 10 minutes to take our order because service is nonexistent at good Chinese mom and pop places. We ordered takeout and it took 30 minutes to get our XLB.\\n\\nCrab meat and pork XLB - very flavorful. You can taste the crab in this. The skin is super thin and explodes with soup once you bite into it.\\n\\nPork XLB - very flavorful. A solid pork xiao long bao. We went to Chinatown to get some good Chinese food and this place was not it. The staff were not that friendly and the food didn't seem well seasoned, like they were missing salt in everything. We got the fried rice, soup dumplings and I got the hot beef soup. The soup was just hot and not flavorful at all. We will not be back unfortunately. CASH ONLY so plan accordingly! Although, if you end up not having cash (like us) there's an atm in front with a service fee.\\n\\nNow to the food! We got the Hong Kong spicy and sour soup, pork soup dumplings, and pan fried crispy noodles, and it was so delicious I wish we could eat it again! If you didn't grow up eating Asian food but is looking to be adventurous, I'd recommend the Hong Kong soup. Otherwise, the other two I feel like are good to be tasty for all levels of Asian food eaters.\\nBtw, they add an automatic service tip to the bill, so if you're not trying to double the tip, keep an eye out on your bill! Joe's Shanghai is wildly popular in Chinatown. It's in a great location and can commonly be found with groups of people waiting outside for their names to be called. I am a huge lover of xiao long bao, so I was looking forward to trying them out. We went in for a later lunch and were seated right away. Despite the odd time, it was still packed.\\n\\nWe ordered the wonton soup and xiao long bao. Honestly, the wontons were almost as juicy as the soup dumplings, so it felt like we were eating two variations of the same dish. Both were phenomenal. The xiao long bao was flavorful, filled with a tasty broth and had great ratios of meat to soup to wrapper. They were relatively large compared to others I've had in the past, so it's amazing that they still tasted so good.\\n\\nThis place deserves the praise. It has an endless menu, which I imagine has many good things from what I could tell from the two things we tried. The staff was friendly and came by a couple times to check in, but they definitely move quickly throughout the dining room. I'm very excited to go back one day to try out so more items, but xiao long baos will always be a staple in my order. This is a popular restaurant with tourists so expect long queue.\\n\\nIt is located close to the Canal and Bowery St intersection.\\n\\nThe food and service were good. Stopped by on a Sunday evening, had to wait about 20 minutes, you'll probably end up sharing a big table if you're a smaller party than 10.\\n\\nNomz: Came here for the soup dumplings, had the pork ones, if it's just two people I would recommend one pork dumplings and something else. Personally, I think only having the dumplings gets repetitive, but you do you.\\nHad the crispy noodles with beef and it was really tasty, would get again! Also have had the Shanghai noodles with chicken, which lacked flavor to me, prefer the crispy ones.\\n\\nService: This place is busy but they are on top of your orders and water, fast moving waiters.\\n\\nAmbiance: It's nice, lots of round tables and two seaters, minimalistic light brown wood, well lit place.\\n\\nNope or Dope: Dope, this is where I get my soup dumpling fix for now :) Joe's is just one of those places you have to try when you come to Chinatown\\n\\nThe restaurant is one of the few that are relatively open with enough seating to dine in.\\nThe food was really good and overall pretty cheap for NY. Not my favorite soup dumplings, but the kung pao was amazing!\\n\\nService was good and we got our food quickly. Joe's Shanghai is well known for a reason! My family waited about 30 minutes to get a table. Once we were seated, the service went pretty quickly from there. We ordered crab and pork soup dumplings, the taro cake appetizer, Peking duck, and some mixed vegetables. The taro cake was not was I was expecting (the dim sum one) but I was pleasantly surprised! It was still really good and I would get it again. The soup dumplings were amazing and so was the duck. Keep in mind it is cash only so come prepared! Was recommended by a friend to try it out because it's a popular Chinese place and she was right. It was sooo busy when we went. Place is also not too big. Tables were pretty close to each other. We were lucky to get a table right away but then lines started to form after us. There was no empty table. Service was okay. They don't really come check on you but they are busy, so maybe that's why. The staff recommended the beef with string beans which we got and I really liked it. The beef was well marinated and not chewy at all. We also got a hot and sour soup, jelly fish, and soup dumplings for appetizer. Everything was pretty good.\\nNote: this place is cash only. Not sure if it's a common thing in Chinatown NY but we didn't know. Stopped in the other day while in Chinatown. We wanted to try some \\\"must have eats\\\" while visiting New York and Joes Shanghai was on our list and was also recommended by my brother. Mom and I ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings and a side of scallion pancakes. According to our waiter, these two items were the most popular on their menu. Soon as we bit into the dumplings, we were delighted by a nice creamy porky crabby surprise sitting in a slurp size spoonful soup. I don't know any way to describe it other than it was a nice meal for a cold winter day. The scallion pancakes were also a delight as well. It was crispy and came with a side of soy sauce for dipping. This is a very popular restaurant so the lines getting on do get long. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait at all. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I'd come back again I think the food here might be the best on planet earth and I'll leave it at that.\\nThe soup dumplings r impeccable\\nThe scallion pancakes r to die for. [Joe's Shanghai] Chinese restaurant known famously for their Xiao Long Bao. They used to have multiple locations however after COVID I think they only have one location\\n\\nThere is quite literally nothing better than this restaurant. I could live off this for the rest of my life. I have been to this restaurant over 20+ times now. Every time I'm in NY I have to make a stop.\\n\\nAlways go for their XLB. They have 2 kinds: pork or pork & crab meat. Personally, I like the pork alone. I usually don't order off the rest of the menu however this one time I did.\\n\\nSteamed chicken w Scallions and ginger sauce\\nClams in black bean sauce\\nChinese spinach\\n\\nI know some individuals are going to comment about rude service but they have to understand that it's an authentic Chinese restaurant. They're not there to be nice, they're there to make sure you get your food and everyone is fed in and out the door. Also, rudeness is sometime a good indicator if you know a Chinese restaurant is good . Ambiance is super busy. Everytime I have been.\\n\\nOverall, 10/10. You can not go wrong with the soup dumplings. Could care less about the rest of the menu.\\n\\nhttps://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com\\n\\n46 Bowery St\\nNew York, NY 10013 This place usually has a line around the block, but it had been a very rainy night and morning, so it was a miracle to have no line and empty tables at noon! They also have a great machine for rainy days which wraps your umbrella into plastic as you walk in (you are obligated to use it by the staff at the front door who will help you figure it out).\\n\\nThey are famous for their soup dumplings, which are huge! We ordered two trays of the pork and crab and devoured the wonderful broth inside the dumplings that brimmed with crab flavor.\\n\\nThe green beans with garlic was also a table favorite.\\n\\nMy friends indulged me as I asked to order the steamed flounder which was not only beautifully presented, but also delicately cooked. 18% automatic service fee for a party of any size.\\n\\nFood was mid, not bad but not good either. Overpriced for what it is. You can find better food elsewhere for cheaper.\\n\\nBathrooms are located a floor below. You have to walk down stairs. If you go to Joe's Shanghai, the soup dumplings are a must try. We ordered the pork and pork+crab soup dumplings and they were both super yummy. My dad even says these are the best he's had in the city. Everything else we ordered - chicken in wine, cold noodles, beef noodles, and some cold tofu dish - was kind of mid in my opinion.\\n\\nThe new location is more modern and very spacious. We arrived at ~10:55 AM and there was a bit of a line but we didn't need to wait very long. Your entire party needs to be present in order to be seated. In 1994, they opened their first Joe's Shanghai in Flushing, New York. It quickly becomes the favorite for all diners up till this day but not in flushing anymore, you'll have to travel to Bowery Street in Manhattan.\\n\\nThe original name for this dumpling is Xiao Long Bao, but due to the complicated pronunciation, simply call it \\\"Soup Dumplings\\\" (based on the soup inside the dumplings). It quickly become an acronym for Joe's Shanghai. Mention \\\"Soup Dumplings\\\", everyone knows you're referring to Joe's Shanghai.\\n\\nIn 1995, they opened their Chinatown restaurant in Pell Street. However, the place proved to be too small to handle the growing capacity they have, so in December 2019, they moved to a nearby location - 46 Bowery, New York.\\n\\nSoup dumplings were delicious as always, The pan fried noodles was just not the same. So little noodles for the amount of beef and vegetables in their delicious gravy on the plate.\\n\\nThey opened at 11 with a small line but within 30-40 minutes it completely filled up. Came here to try the food as I had read so many reviews about the dumplings here - this place is located in China town and we got here around 6:30 and got seated around 7 pm. This place has a nice ambience for a Chinese restaurant and the seating was also quite comfy. The service is mediocre though as the food took forever to come out in between dishes. We ended up ordering:\\n\\n* pork soup dumpling - large pieces lots of soup and flavor\\n\\n*crab soup dumpling - unique flavor and yummy taste\\n\\n* sesame chicken - crispy and crunchy on the sweeter side\\n\\n* lo mein noodles with beef - terrible with no flavor I would definitely skip this\\n\\nOverall, didn't meet the hype for me but nice Chinese spot with lots of options for food. I went here after I had Jury Duty since I was craving Xiao long bao and it did not disappoint! It was pretty busy but I was able to be seated immediately since I got there right before the lunch rush. I got the regular pork Xiao long bao and then one of my staple of scallion pancakes. All was great! Make sure you have cash though because they only accept cash. I will say that it is a little pricier than some other places and they also automatically charge an 18% service charge. But otherwise would come here again! Whenever I pass by here, there's always a long line. Decided to just take it to go to see what the hypes about.\\nI ordered the pork meat soup dumplings and I was impressed. The skin was slightly chewy and thin. The meat was tender and packed with soup. Simply delicious. We came here for one recommendation, and it was worth it, but definately not during peak hours. For some reason the line here is ridiculously filled with every tourist. It can take up to an hour during peak season to get a table, which is wild. Its not too much different from many other similar locations in the nearby area. The servers are clearly overworked imo, and sometimes take a very long time to get the bill, take an order etc, and its just a very chaotic environment.\\n\\nIts hard to hear people, and for parties less then 5, there is a solid chance you are splitting a table with a friend. Despite these flaws, the food here still is solid. The soup dumplings are a much order, and are absolutely filled and delightful. Full of soup, and ready to explode, be careful eating them. The shanghai noodles I ordered were also great. The food is a 5/5 and I would recommend this place more often to people if the line did not extend across the manhattan bridge (this is an exaggeration). Also please note that this place is cash only. Always our go to place when we visit NYC! Service is quick and efficient. There is a wait no matter what day it is. The soup dumpling never disappoints. I had the scallion pancake and the pork soup dumpling. The scallion pancake was dry and bland to my taste The wait is pretty long. They quoted us 20 minutes but it ended up taking closer to 45mins. We were about to leave after 30 mins. I went to check where we were in the line before leaving and the lady told me we were next. Shortly after they called us in and then we waited another 15 mins by the counter. The person in the back came by the counter and yelled at the person in the front and then they let two other families through.\\n\\nAfter being seated, service was pretty quick. They almost immediately brought our water and asked if we were ready to order. Some would say they have the best soup dumplings but it didn't pass in my book. They were good but not great. My son really enjoyed the crispy shredded beef; I thought it was ok. It reminded me of the Beijing beef at Panda Express which is fast food.\\n\\nFYI they are cash only. They do have an atm machine at the entrance. I liked dining here. Soup dumplings came first then around time we finished dumplings, noodle came out. I like eating crispy noodles and husband likes to drench then in sauce before eating them.\\n\\nService was fast. I'd like to return to try different menus! I have no idea why this place has so many reviews and why people wait so long to get a table here. The good is super average and tbh white people bland. I took a group of my chinese friends with me and we all were shocked at how low the bar was.\\nTypically when you sit down u get offered tea in any traditional chinese restaurant. Also it's almost inevitable you can order chow fun.. first time i don't see chow fun on a chinese menu?! Then we had to beg to get rice with dishes that come with it. Horrible service and just not worth it. There are far better places I have been to in Chinatown Waited over an hour! Safe to say the soup dumplings are delicious. I recommend going with a large party, faster to get seated and large portions for a good price. I think we ordered the wrong dishes. The pork shoulder was good but a bit bland in flavors and the noodles as well. I would Iike to try more. Authentic is always good! not bad for just general chinese food! they had a pretty large menu from dimsum to more typical restaurant dishes. service was especially good, the waiters brought us extra wraps for the duck since we had more people.\\n\\nscallion pancakes (8/10) - hit the spot, crispy but not oily! would recommend for sharing\\n\\npork xiao long baos (9/10) - some of the better xlbs i've had in ny! i prefer xlb that doesn't have really thick skin so this was perfect for me.\\n\\npeking duck (7/10) - pretty standard but portion was kinda small for half a duck. only comes with 4 wraps by default.\\n\\nstring beans (8/10) - pretty standard but this dish is still a great choice for veggies\\n\\nstir fry tofu and veggies (9/10) - waiter recommended this as an add-on and it was surprisingly good! the tofu really gets all the flavor and there's a wide assortment of veggies included\\n\\n\\u6885\\u83dc\\u6263\\u8089 (pickled vegetable pork belly? not sure the english menu item name) (5/10) - the sauce felt to thick and salty for my taste. and the pork belly slices were also really thick and a bit too fatty. wasn't terrible but would pass since there's better items! This is not the Joe's I remember on Doyer. This new Bowery location is modern and spacious. Soup dumplings remain above par. The've got a nice amount of soup inside medium thickness wrappers. Joes is the only place in CTown I know that also serves a delicious braised tofu over a bed of steamed spinach. ***CASH ONLY***\\n\\nThey will take card but needed like a $20 minimum. Also they charge 18% tip regardless of how many people are in your party.\\n\\nI came here just after they opened for the day, and it wasn't too busy yet. I literally only ordered one plate of pork soup dumplings. Gosh, they were hella juicy. I see why some places use a straw!\\n\\nHonestly I didn't like having to suck all the soup out first before eating the dumpling. If I didn't, I would choke on it. Also, I had to be very careful with removing the dumpling from the crate or else the skin would puncture and soup would spill out.\\n\\nThis place does XLB good though. Soup dumplings are what to get here. We got the crab and pork soup dumplings and one order came with eight of them. The soup dumplings are piping-hot, so be careful biting into one of these delicious treats. Between the two of us, we barely finished two orders. Really good soup dumplings.\\n\\nSeating is rather crammed... just like New York, but if you don't mind shuffling sideways to get into the area where your table is, then you have nothing to worry about.\\n\\nBATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms are located down the stairs and is decent. It is a single person bathroom with a working toilet and urinal and sink. Sit or squat? Squat. The first place I ever tried Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings), and it took years before I found other restaurants outside of NYC that served them. I always stop at Joe's Shanghai anytime I'm in NY. Expect a wait for a table, but it is absolutely worth it. All the food is great and served family style. After reading the rave reviews about this place I headed there and it did not disappoint! Everything that was brought to the table was absolute perfection. The soup dumplings were probably the best I've had (now the bar is so high) and the rest of the dishes were all perfectly seasoned and so authentic. We ordered the sauteed flat noodles which were so yummy and long! We also ordered fried rice, wonton soup and Beef and green beans. Portions of noodles and rice were great to share but I wish there was more of the beef as it was amazing. There was a long line but we only waited for about 15 mins or so. This is now a place I will come back to everytime I'm in the area. Dumplings! They're the draw, but the rest of the menu is solid, too!\\n\\nIt'd been years between visits. They even relocated to the Bowery from Pell St in the intervening time! The experience was still very familiar. About a 20-30 minute wait in the street for a table, followed by excellent pork soup dumplings and less gratifying pork and crab dumplings (skip them and double down on the pork). Their eggplant in garlic sauce was delicious. Scallion pancakes were solid as an app, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nIt was a nice visit that lived up to expectations and recollections in all respects, except that the space is brighter, cleaner, and far newer. I do, however, miss the pictures posted in the old space. I'd recommend it! Stopped in for a quick snack while! we were in the area. We tried the pork soup, dumplings, and scallion pancakes, both were amazing! We'll definitely be back on our next NYC! trip to try out the other dishes. The food are bad so I only took picture of the soup dumpling, the only dish that I like lol Would have been a 1 star if not for the soup dumpling.\\n\\n~ Pork Meat Soup Dumpling \\u5c0f\\u7c60\\u6e6f\\u5305 (3.5/5) ~\\nIt's a good Chinese style soup dumpling, generous portion, a lot of yummy soup inside. The dumpling is on the thicker side (which is the way it is in China), it's not bad but I prefer Taiwanese style with the thin and smooth dumpling skin (like din tai fung).\\n\\n~ House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken \\u70b8\\u6e9c\\u5b50\\u96de (1/5) ~\\nWe asked the server whether Crispy Chicken in Ginger Sauce (\\u8106\\u76ae\\u6cb9\\u6dcb\\u96de) is \\u70b8\\u5b50\\u96de (which is a crispy skin chicken) and he pointed us to House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken (\\u70b8\\u6e9c\\u5b50\\u96de), which turns out to be wrong. I mean he speak Cantonese how can he not know what is \\u70b8\\u5b50\\u96de ? Lol\\nAfter the dish was served we were shocked, but accepted the dish nonetheless. It is SO WEIRD. It's sweet & sour pork but the chicken version. We have never had a chicken version before and it felt SO WRONG. We grew up with the pork version, which is like 99% of what are served in Hong Kong. Plus it's a bit too sweet, and the fried chicken is quite dry and not tender. Maybe a foreigner would love and devour this dish, but not us.\\n\\n~ Buffalo Carp Fish Belly in Brown Sauce \\u7d05\\u71d2\\u9bc7\\u9b5a\\u8169 (0/5) ~\\nWorst fish I have ever had in my entire life!!!!!!! It has a super strong stinky, smelly, fishy taste, it's revolting! For god sake did they not use ginger?!?!?! It's outright inedible. Did not touch the fish after few bites I just can't.\\n\\n~ Saut\\u00e9ed Seasonal Vegetables \\u6e05\\u7092\\u6642\\u83dc (2/5) ~\\nStir fry vegetables is a basic Chinese dish but this is not done well. Vegetables used were odd, not the typical ones you'd get. The sauce is very runny and oily.\\n\\nWill I be back? No\\nDid not enjoy any of the dishes we got (except for the soup dumpling). Perhaps there are other dish that are good, but I'm not paying my own money to find out by trial and error. The dishes here are from Shanghai apparently (as the name denotes).\\n\\nBeware: They don't accept reservations and Cash ONLY.\\n\\n1. Food\\n\\n*Scallion pancake - just ok and wish they gave us more than 2 small dishes for the sauce\\n*Pork and Veggie dumplings - no question of course the pork dumplings were flavorful so skip the veggie dumplings unless looking for vegetarian dish\\n*Squid with salt and jalape\\u00f1o - still loved Hop Li (LA Chinatown) version\\n*Whole Peking Duck - for a whole duck, skimpy serving of the green onions (not sure why) and the sauce. It was served with these tortilla-like wrap which we did not like for to us did not compliment the duck. We still prefer those fluffy white buns\\n*Orange Beef - it was recommended and it was everyone's favorite dish\\n\\n*Service - we had a water spill and they quickly mopped it so really appreciated that\\n\\nThere were a lot of people waiting when we got there at 6 pm. We were given a ticket with our number and were told the wait was for 30-40 minutes. At 35 minutes, they called our party of 5 - not a bad estimation from the hostess\\n\\nIt was pricey as far as we were all concerned and the servings are not big.\\n\\nIt is a very popular restaurant in Chinatown (NY) and I can see why. If this is your first time and wanted to try Chinese food in NY - solid Chinese restaurant to try for first time visitors. During our visits to New York City we like to check new restaurants and return to favorites. Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown is a favorite and this was the first time we went to their new location on Bowery. They moved to this location about 4 years ago. The setting is more contemporary and the service is excellent.\\nThe main draw are their soup dumplings, we had the crabmeat and pork version which remain as the best anywhere we try them.\\nWe also had the Eggplant with garlic, Crispy Shredded beef, Crispy (glazed) Jumbo prawns, Chicken Lo Mein with chicken.\\nEach of these was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by the five of us. We will continue to keep in our list for future visits when we are back in New York.\\nThe flavors and taste of each subsequent dish were so good that I could not be distracted and therefore I have no other pictures Solid spot for some Chinese food with big portions for the price. It is a cash only place, although there is an ATM right at the entrance.\\n\\nCrab and Pork Soup Dumplings - Definitely get these. For $14, you get an order of 8 HUGE soup dumplings. The skin is a bit too thick for my liking, but the filling is juicy and flavorful!\\n\\nLion's Head Meatballs - I did not expect there to be this many meatballs lol, each one is gigantic. A Shanghai classic and these were flavorful and the texture was nice\\n\\nCrispy beef - My white friend ordered this LMAOO but honestly it wasn't bad. Kind of sweet but the beef had a crispy exterior and was tender inside\\n\\nPea leaf - Solid vegetable dish, no complaints here FYI they are cash only!! There was also an 18% service charge.\\n\\nWe ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, shrimp fried rice and pepper duck. The dumplings were good, but the shrimp fried rice and duck were only okay. We had to ask for sauce for the duck because even with the seasoning and lemon it had no flavor. Classic old style Chinese restaurant. Food was good the service good as well. Dim Sum was very tasty. Good to try it once but it was too traditional for me. There's a reason why this place is always packed and crowded, even on a random Tuesday night. Before you even get seated, you need to make sure you have cash on hand. This place is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM inside the restaurant just in case you forget.\\n\\nService: The service here is super fast. They take your order, and your food comes out nice and hot. Depending on your group size, you'll have to wait a little bit to be seated. They really make use of the space and seating arrangements. If you have a smaller party, you might be seated with another table. I'm not shy when it comes to making new friends, so that didn't bother me at all.\\n\\nFood: I haven't had the chance to try everything on their menu, but I am sure it's super tasty. My go-to order is their XLB Soup Dumplings. You haven't lived until you've tried this. I'm sure some of you are wondering, is it as good as Ding Tai Fung? And my answer will always be, heck yeah!!! Make sure to set up your dipping sauce. Mix it well, and then dip your XLB in that sauce. One of my friends gave me a tip on how to get the best of the soup in one bite. You gotta puncture the bottom of the dumpling and place it on your spoon to make sure the soup doesn't spill all over. This also helps cool down the hot temperature and avoids burning your tongue. The other items we ordered were the Egg Flower Soup, perfect to have on a cold, New York evening. Their Pan Fried Noodles were also very tasty, and their Shanghai Noodles were also a hit. We were so full! We had plenty of leftovers for the next day. My only wish is that they'll open up a Joe's Shanghai in California someday! As there are numbers of Chinese diaspora rooted North America decades ago, it isn't difficult to search for authentic Chinese cuisine in NYC. The quality of Joe's Shanghai were so impressive that I will even rate it as the BEST Shanghainese restaurant I have ever been to. All the dishes were mouth-watering. Even the crowd is always insane till late night, it still worths the long wait.\\n\\n\\uff0aPork Meat Soup Dumplings\\n\\uff0aJelly Fish\\n\\uff0aWine Chicken\\n\\uff0aPork Fried Dumplings\\n\\uff0aBraised Sea Cucumber in Brown Sauce\\n\\uff0aSauteed String Bean (w.

YES I am craving for it already Really busy place in Manhattan Chinatown. There's a long wait but it doesn't take too long to get through. The XLB is really good. I also had the Shanghai noodle soup and it was a good broth. The seating is tight inside where it feels like the tables are a little too close to each other and you're going to bump someone as get in to your seat. The service is pretty decent for what you'd get at any Chinatown restaurant. Cash only.e Biggest Xiao Long Bao spotted in Chinatown! After they moved to a bigger location they also upsized their XLB! Even though the skin eventually got thicker but it's still the same deliciousness. As for the Peking duck, not as crispy as I would've expected.\\n\\nBy the way, don't get intimidated by the line out there cause everyone is expected to wait 30 mins+ but got called in 15 mins! Firs time in almost 20 years ago. I have some great memories at this place and about some great food I had...and not so fun memory of long waiting times.\\n\\nWhat has happened to this place or did my pallet change or get sophisticated so much thru Michelin restaurants, etc.\\n\\nFood - dude. What happened to soup dumplings. Greasy meat and soup, the broth inside had disgusting white gooey stuff. Dumpling ski was thick. Yuck!!! And the twice fried noodles...no real ingredient but msg laden sauce. What happened here?\\n\\nAmbiance - much better than before but a lot of wasted space and ceiling is just too high for the space. Weird.\\n\\nService - not bad for a busy (?) Chinese restaurant\\n\\nPrice - not cheap for a Chinese restaurant Ordered the General Tso chicken, spicy Szechuan beef, pork dumplings, wonton soup, shrimp fried rice, and prawns. Everything was amazing. I did enjoy the wonton soup a lot more than the dumplings! The General Tzo sauce was perfect. It was not syrupy or in excess. Some places tend to go heavy on the sauce. The place is clean, lots of attentive staff, quick service and delicious food. We loved the scallion pancakes and dumplings. Definitely coming back with family and will try the pecking duck. They only accepts cash, there's ATM outside but it's better to have cash in handy. I have dined here over a few times and every time it is delicious to get some authentic soup dumplings. We ordered the pork soup dumplings and it was very plump and juicy. I enjoyed it and a great early lunch option for me. Service was great, the waiter is always around and able to catch their attention if we needed anything.\\n\\nThey did moved since the last time I came. This new place is more spacious and nice. They do have restrooms, which is downstairs. the stairs are a little narrow so be careful. This is the third stop of our food tour as I have heard so much about this place from my east coast peeps.\\n\\nMy main purpose is to try their XLB. So, we ordered the crab XLB and standard pork XLB for the four of us. Hubby wants to try their smoked fish, but they said they ran out. So, he ordered the salted duck. I think it's way too salty. But my hubby likes it.\\n\\nOnto to the XLB. The skin is much thicker than I thought. However, it is a very juicy XLB. I am the only one who likes the crab one. Rest of the table prefer the standard pork one. Kiddos think the crab one tasted funky - whatever that means.\\n\\nServers are ok. I wouldn't say they are friendly. They are more indifference. Overall, I would say it's 3.5 stars. I have rounded it up to 4 stars as it's pricing is ok. Remember it's cash only!! This place gets really packed. This place ONLY ACCEPTS CASH, but they do have an ATM where you can withdraw cash. I ordered the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings, which comes in 8 and Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noodle. The Pork Meat Soup was okay...the meat was a bit bland but tasted well with the vinegar and soy sauce mix they provided. The Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noodle was really good and seasoned well! The service here was great, everyone was on top of it and would come by and change your dirty plates to clean plates. If you need something, they're quick to give it to you.\\n\\nRecommendation(s):\\n- Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noodle\\n\\nService: 5/5\\n\\nTip(s):\\n- Accepts only cash, but they do have an ATM One of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever visited. Very, very busy and can be very crowded, as it is obviously very popular. Consider take-out, which apparently many people do as there was a stream of delivery people the whole time and a row of packed bags waiting. Also very efficient--the orders come out in minutes.\\n\\nWe had Xiao Long Bao, peanut sauce noodles, and onion cakes, all top notch, served hot. Portions are generous. Huge menu selection, great dishes, and the servers were very nice. \\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\nString beans: Refreshing. Great side dish\\nPork meat soup dumplings: the soup was flavorful. I thought the dumpling skin was a bit thick\\nCrab meat with pork soup dumplings: our fav! the crab flavorful really shined through They live up to the hype!!! Stopped by recently on a whim while mosing around on Bowery and was reminded just how good their soup dumplings are. I like mine piping hot so I made sure to request them as such. The last couple of spots I went to for soup dumpling served them just on the cool side of warm (did I just make up a new phrase?!). Not this day though.. they were piping hot just as I asked. If I didn't have places to be afterwards, I could have easily devoured another 2 more baskets full. No photos from me on this review as I was in the soup dumpling zone. Must go for the soup dumplings!!!\\n\\nWe also got the eggplant and pork and it was amazing. Service was fast. Don't miss this spot! First time visit. No waiting line cause today is raining. Quickly get seated, the staff forgot to give us water so we have to ask to remind them. Ordered their popular dishes.\\n\\nSpent over $100.\\n\\nXLB: it's not authentic XLB, the flavor is kinda off. I don't like it.\\n\\nFried scallion pancake: I didn't finish the whole thing. Too greasy, and not crispy.\\n\\nThe dessert soup is way too sweet.\\n\\nI had a really high expectation before coming, and left with disappointment. Nothing special. Would not come back again. I was so so excited to finally get to try this Michelin rated Shanghai dumpling spot that people have been raving about for years! Sadly, it didn't blow my mind away. Luckily I came at an off about on a weekday around 3:30 pm so there was no crazy lines outside so I had no wait time. The inside is nothing special, it's your typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere....loud and a lot going on.\\n\\nI only wanted to try their famous soup dumplings so I ordered one set. They came out very quickly and were huge. I've never seen these types of dumplings so big. The filling and soup were just ok, what I didn't like was the outside skin. It was so thick and doughy almost bread like....not delicate at all. Sadly, it did NOT hit the mark for me. Maybe it was an off day or this place is just overrated.\\n\\nThe place is CASH ONLY! Unfortunately, these did NOT blow my mind away like I was hoping for after all these high reviews. Went here with some friends! Got here around 5:30 and got seated right away.However, when we left, the line to get seated was so long! We got there right on time.\\n\\nFood:\\nBeef broccoli - 10/10 delicious !\\nKung pao chicken - 7/10 the chicken was bit dry\\nFried rice - 6/10 the fried rice was missing soy sauce? It tasted bland.\\nSoup dumplings - usually 10/10 but yesterday 7/10\\n\\nService: fast and got our food ready quick! I needed him to slow down when taking our order but it's okay. We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday and were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a party of 2. We waited less than 5 minutes and were called to our table.\\n\\nWe've been wanting to try their famous soup dumplings for years and todays the day we finally did. We ordered their pork soup dumplings.\\n\\nI wasn't sure how to eat them at first so I glanced to the table next to us. I saw they used chopsticks to poke at the dumplings and to let the soup drain out into the spoon. So, that's what I did. It was a little messy to eat but I got the hang of it.\\n\\nThe pork soup dumplings were delicious and were perfect on this 30 degree day.\\n\\nRemember, it's a cash only restaurant! Great food!\\nExcellent dumpling. We tried vegetables. Prices were reasonable; they only accept cash, and I wouldn't say I liked that. They have an ATM inside, but I prefer to pay by card.\\nOverall, the\\nfood was delicious. I had a light bite at Joe's Shanghai, because it was convenient for a business meeting. I liked it well enough to suggest it for dinner with another couple at the end of the month, and they selected this from among the three options I listed.\\nThey were bustling before the dinner hour, or what would be an early supper, just after 5pm. They had a mix of people.\\nThe server was fast. He was gracious.\\nWe had the rice noodles (rice cake) with seafood and a dumpling soup. The former was a bit smoky, which is good. The latter was fresh, tasty, healthy, and clean; it had watercress, which whenever I eat it, I think I need to have that vegetable more often.\\nFor a casual, not expensive, but friendly and family friendly restaurant, you should consider Joe's Shanghai. A beautiful new facility on Bowery Street, have been dining at Joe's for over a decade. Joe's is my go-to place for quality soup dumplings. In that the dumplings are my favorite, and I don't eat a large volume of food, it doesn't allow me to enjoy much more from their extensive menu. Crab and pork and pork dumplings are rich with flavorful stock, and the wrapping is thin and silky. It is difficult to write this review without wanting to taste their delightful dumplings. It is a good thing they offer the option to purchase frozen dumplings to take home for later. Just make sure you request extra ginger/vinegar for dipping. They even send the perfect paper to put in your home steamer when you take out frozen dumplings! Food is delish, the service quick.... Expect a wait, so dont be a prick.... It is a CASH ONLY restaurant Highly recommend the soup dumplings! Hit the spot on a cold winter day. Note that there is usually a wait, but it moves quickly! Your run of the mill good Chinese place with great soup dumplings\\nTbh no place is good enough to wait for 3h but if you can get a table on time you're in good hands :)\\n\\nFast service, lots of food, reasonable price\\n\\nRecommend the soup dumplings, while fish dish, Peking duck, beef schezwan style but maybe not the scallion pancakes\\n\\nThey give oranges with the check which I love So my original plan was to go to Chinatown during the day, but we ended up going at night and a lot of places had already closed. I found this place had so many reviews so we were thinking it was going to be a tourist trap. Actually, though, it was pretty amazing! The soup dumplings are michellin-rated and a must try! We also were super indecisive on what else to order but we ended up getting general tso chicken and it was amazing!\\n\\nThey had us sit with a table of 6 at a big table, which was kind of strange at first, but we adjusted and were just happy to not have to wait even longer. We ended up waiting probably 20-25 minutes.\\n\\nEveryone was super nice.\\n\\nIt is kind of loud, so not the best spot to talk to someone, but the vibes are still exciting. There is a bit of a wait, but the place is huge so it goes by quickly - 20 mins max. They are cash only and everything we ordered was delicious.\\n\\nThe crab and pork XLBs were huge and delish! They have some kind of vinegar at the table already to eat it with. Crispy shredded beef is a must order. This is a dish that would make me want to come back again and again. The string beans were also yummy. The mined pork cooked with it was a little salty but didn't affect the string beans flavor. Shanghai saut\\u00e9ed noodles could've been a little more flavorful but we're still good. All this for a party of 4 were perfect portions!\\n\\nThe servers were attentive and around often. There is an automatic 18% gratuity added to your bill so no need to worry about tip. I love its Xiaolongbao!\\nMy friends in NY love the dumplings they even asked me how I discovered the shop. Yelp!\\nI ordered online and so there was no wait.\\nThe shop is compact and efficient. We were on our N.Y food tour and just ate at Xi'an but had to stop by next door for the dumplings. Man were these soup dumplings plump. The texture and flavor were all there. Not only were the dumplings delicious, but they were also large in size which is always a plus.\\n\\nSoup Dumplings\\n- Beef 5/5\\n- Crab 5/5\\n\\nShanghai Noodles 5/5 (Top it off with a little bit of their satay and it was chef's kiss)\\n\\nMind you, we were so full and still managed to stuff our faces. I've been to the original location more than 10 years ago and that was the first time I've ever had Xioa Long Bao. I knew this place was famous and wanted to try it again. Luckily for me, I didn't have to wait too long for a table for 1. Normally, you do have to wait. Since it was just me I could only order 1 dish and that was their Xio Long Bao. The portion sizes are HUGE! This can feed a family of 4. Let's just say people that come to Joe's are usually a bigger group. Therefore, this dish is suited for a large group. 1 person was too much and because it was huge I couldn't try anything else in the menu. The dumplings are really soupy and they are generous with the meat. You are also paying for it too because a basket of the dumplings aren't cheap.\\n\\nIn general, 1 dumpling was already popped and the soup spilled on the basket. (hence the picture) Therefore, I am disappointed in the presentation. Also, heads up there is an automatic 18% gratuity. Cash only!!! My FAVORITE soup dumplings ever. I've tried soup dumplings all over NYC and the country and these are it! Yes, you'll have to wait a while for a spot to sit and eat but it truly is worth it. Go at an odd hour and it'll be faster! General tsos chicken & fried rice are my favorite entrees here. The wonton soup is sooo delicious. The pork wontons inside are amazing and the broth is really incredible. Highly recommend here! Came here on a Sunday around 11:00 for lunch. The place was already half filled with patrons. By 12:15, it was full. We were waited on right away. And the servers were attentive and did not forget anything. They checked on us, changed our plates mid meal and made sure our water cups were always full. The place was a bit on the noisy side with great conversations all around. Good for families, but not for intimate dates.\\n\\nWe ordered two different kinds of dumplings, two different noodle dishes, green beans and salt&pepper pork chops. All was cooked and flavored well. We were not disappointed with anything. Serving sizes were as expected. Everyone says it and it is definitely true. Joe's has THE BEST soup dumplings.\\n\\nBut quite honestly, they have some of the best classic Chinese dishes I've ever had here. I can see why it is so popular.\\n\\nIf you're wondering if it is worth the wait; YES!\\n\\nAlso, be sure to bring cash.\\n\\n5/5 We stood in line for 45 minutes to be seated. We read the reviews and were very excited about this place but let's just say we've had much better food in Chinatown. Scallion pancakes were delicious, but pork dumpling soup was dry on the outside and bland on the inside. Pecking duck was our biggest disappointment. More than half of it was just fat. We didn't even eat a third of it. Unfortunately, I don't recommend this place. If you're looking for traditional soup dumplings, this probably isn't the spot for you. I had heard about Joe's Shanghai from many different spots that recommended NYC eats, so I figured I would give them a try. There was quite a lot of people waiting, but we got our number called in around 20 minutes. However, from there they still made us wait another 20 minutes or so which felt weird.\\n\\nWe decided to only get soup dumplings since that is what they're known for, and got an order of the pork and another of the crab and pork. They arrived pretty quickly, and we were all quite shocked when they opened the steamer basket because of how large they were. These are probably around double the size of your normal xiaolongbao, so a single order of 8 is actually quite a lot. The skin was also a lot thicker than normal, which my friends and I didn't really prefer. There was definitely plenty of soup inside, but the soup had some weird gelatinous bits within which was odd to eat. Between the two, we felt the classic pork was better but the crab wasn't too bad either.\\n\\nI don't think I'd return, but at least I got to try for myself the soup dumplings that people always talk about from here. Not traditional, but acceptable. This place was PACKED on a Saturday lunchtime. I was told the wait time for party of 2 was 15 min but waited about 20 min.\\n\\nWe ordered the pork soup dumplings which was amazing it's definitely a MUST TRY and the serving portions was huge. It arrived first and didn't get the noodles until much later, I had to follow up twice to get it.\\n\\nWhen the Shanghai saut\\u00e9ed udon noodles arrived it was pretty good but honestly not worth the wait. I'm docking a star for the lack of ambiance, it was too crowded and no music which I consider an important part of the experience. I would come here again on a weekday and order the pork dumplings again.\\n\\nValue - 5/5\\nAmbiance - 3/5\\nFood - 4/5 JUST AMAZING. Obviously get the soup dumplings. We got 3 servings for 4 people which was a lot, I would say 2 would be enough for 4 people. The scallion pancakes were perfectly crispy and flavorful. Not pictured is the crispy noodles with beef (5/5 - you must get this without question!!). Service was fast and I loved that they cleared our table as we ate. The ambience is just as expected, fast paced with cute decor that wasn't overwhelming.\\n\\nDon't forget it's cash only! Visited Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown for dinner based on a recommendation. The 25-minute wait for seating was tolerable given the restaurant's size and comfort. The servers were sweet, but unfortunately, the food lacked flavor and felt overpriced. Beware, it's cash-only, and there's an automatic 18% gratuity. Overall, a mediocre experience with nothing noteworthy to rave about. I want the service charge from my dinner last night refunded. And I deserve interest and hazard pay.\\n\\nYou did not earn a tip and shouldn't be able to charge a service charge when service sucked.\\n\\nService was terrible, staff were rude and poorly trained. No communication, literally snatching things off the table under our spoons. My God! You take my plate while I'm still chewing my last bite!?! What jerks!\\n\\nChairs were dirty. Literally there was a pea in the debris that I had to wipe off my seat.\\n\\nThe food was fine, nothing special, but the dining experience was horrendous.\\n\\nWe were seated in a terrible location, in the service area, at the top of the stairs to the restroom. I am not exaggerating that there was never a 10 second break without someone inches from our bumping into our table or actually leaning over us and our table. God I miss COVID social distancing after that claustrophobic experience.\\n\\nI want my money back. You did not earn a service charge.\\n\\nShame on you for treating your guests like this. I saw people renting and raving about this place online, and it completely held up. My sister and I can completely ravished after a day of shopping so I was ordering a lot lol. We ordered a scallion pancake, which was absolutely amazing. The outside was perfectly crisp on the very edges in the inside was thick and flavorful.\\nNext, we got the soup dumplings, which were so big and flavorful. They came out piping hot which I love and I didn't realize they were so big. I also ordered some lo mein. We also ordered some spring rolls which are also really good. The service was great. They came to our table in a timely fashion, and we were out of there in no time. This place is great for a casual lunch or dinner, and also accommodates large groups. The Decor was pretty too, so it also works for a great date spot. Hands down one of the best places to eat in all of NYC. The food was amazing. The service was great! The atmosphere was authentic and inviting. Definitely try the dumpling appetizer! Visited Joe's Shanghai on a Sunday afternoon in-between sightseeing adventures. It was busy, and they asked us if we minded sharing a table. We didn't, so they sat us right away towards the back where there was a big table and another family eating already. Service was quick and efficient. The place was hopping! We got the famous pork meat soup dumplings and they did NOT disappoint! We also ordered the crispy shredded beef and some steamed rice. I enjoyed the beef dish, but my daughter said it was too sweet. Overall, it was a great experience. Cash only and there is an ATM inside the restaurant. I'm done with this place. It's been mediocre for quite a few years but today the best of the dishes (salt & pepper shrimp; pork soup dumplings) could most charitably be described as mediocre, while the rest of it (scallops & prawns with garlic sauce; kung pao chicken) was revolting. The scallops & prawns was particularly disgusting -- salty and fishy tasting to the point of being inedible and, at $31, a rip-off. What's nastier than foul-tasting, stanky seafood? This place has gone from good (in the 1990s and 00s), to hit-or-miss, to consistently mediocre, to consistently bad.\\n\\nI've probably eaten here over 100 times since it first opened in the 1990s. The wait staff used to be friendly and the food was pretty good. It's mostly gross now and I have no desire to eat there again. I came here for trying out their pecking duck. It was decent in tasting. There is not much flavor and dry but the meat was cooked perfectly. I would rather try the soup dumplings next time. The Shanghai rice was very flavorful. This was excellent, and the soup dumplings are among the best you can get, but in a blind taste test against some of the other standard-bearers in the area, I don't think I'd definitively put these ahead, despite being more expensive and always having a line to get in. Also, we got a bunch of other dishes and while they were all good, I don't think there were any particular standouts. I also wish they had pan-fried buns, which I prefer even to the regular XLB at most places.\\n\\nOn the soup dumplings specifically -- these were excellent and I'd love to be sitting in front of them again at some point. I do think they're a bit bigger than they ideally should be, just in that it makes bites a little more awkward, but I still loved them. Food: terrible. Extremely greasy and every single bite is coated in salty, greasy sauce. The sauce wasn't even mixed well, some piece of vegetables have so much sauce while some has no sauce.\\n\\nService: terrible. The waiter seemed very rude and didn't even want to hear our questions. Condescending tone.\\n\\nAmbience: ok. Just stopped in after walking around china town. Great food, Large portions and open late! Highly recommend. Soup steam dumpling is the best. Very nice and fresh taste. Must to have here.\\nBeijing duck is not good, eatable but below average. Too dry and not well seasoned. Heard lots of hype surrounding this place and the long line outside must mean it is good. Their signature items are the XLBs and we got the pork and crab versions. These aren't the smaller bite size kind and were bigger and each packed a lot of soup plus the wrapping was thin and very good. For side dishes and were mostly Cantonese style and we got the garlic pea vine shoots that came out cooked well and not overly done. The deep fried pork spare ribs were fairly good and came with a side of spicy sweet dipping sauce and salt and pepper. We also had the dry style chow mein that had a medley of veggies, shrimp and pork on top of a bed of dry noodles. Our servers were great and attentive to our needs and checked on us regularly. Now would I call this life changing? And would I say it's the best XLBs? On both fronts I'd have to say \\\"no\\\" but it ranked high and I'd leave this up to each person's own interpretation. To me it's kinda of like burgers and just because one person raves about it doesn't mean someone else might say it was alright. All in all a satisfying place to go! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! We were told the line is estimated to be about 15 mins. Cool. It's our first time here, we wanted to wait inside cos it started raining. The girl at the front told us to wait around the corner and not inside. Okay we waited around the corner. After like 20 mins I was like why is it taking so long? But thought maybe they're just busy. Finally after 30 mins we decided to ask the girl when will it be our turn. Lol turns out she already called our number? I've been looking at her she doesn't even step a foot out of that restaurant, how can she expect us to hear her when she's the one that told us to wait around the corner?\\n\\nYou would think they should put you back on top as a priority but no lol, she had the audacity to tell us we needed to wait longer aka putting us at the bottom of the list again?? I can't believe she was serious. Overall bad experience right from the start. There are so many other Shanghainese restaurants around here. We will not be coming back in the future.\\n\\nEdit: manager and server were pretty good so an extra star for them. Always a must when we visit NYC. Thankfully we got here close to opening time so didn't have to wait. I always get the sesame chicken .. cooked and fried so well! it's crispy and not too saucy or salty. The soup dumplings are a staple. Right amount of flour and meat / soup. They are always so hot so careful when biting into them! We really enjoy coming here and the new location is way better! I came here to try their soup dumplings XLB and it was alright. I felt like it needed more flavor. I think you do get a bang for your buck here because the dumplings are HUGE and it comes with a shareable quantity. I also ordered the fried dumplings and it was alright too. overall, i thought the dumplings here lacked flavor and i needed it to be a little more savory.\\n\\nit gets crowded really quickly on a weekend so be sure to come at opening around 11am. Joe's Shanghai should be on the top of everyone's list. I first went here a couple of years ago and have since returned recently. There's a reason why there's usually a wait and even people like AOC and Justice Sotomayor eat here (as indicated by their pictures on the wall). Thankfully when we went, we were able to get right in because there was only two of us. Their scallion pancakes were amazing, and the general tsos chicken is some of the very best I've ever had. A friend recommended I try the soup dumplings and I must say they didn't disappoint. I love the interior design as well, plus our server was very thorough. The only critique I would make is that they only take cash, which is a bit of hindrance when you're eating at a nicer restaurant. But overall, you won't be disappointed and it's definitely worth the trip to Chinatown to eat at Joe's. Xiao Long Bao and Vegetable Dumplings\\n\\nDefinitely really good xlbs! Large and flavorful, good portion sizes for the price. Not sure that I can confidently say these are definitely the best xlbs in NYC, but they certainly were impressive! Vegetable dumplings were great too No reservations and cash only !!\\n\\nTheir XLBs were way better than Din Tai Fung's not gonna lie And the crepes/wraps for the Peking duck were perfectly thin! I can see why this place is so popular. I had first tried it many years ago at their original location in Flushing. This new hub has been open for a while now and there's always a line out the door and down the block. It's popular with tourist and locals alike. I can't say it's my favorite soup dumpling spot, but it's definitely worth a stop. My friends sing praises to the orange beef fish, while I found it too sweet and not sure how I feel about it after the first try. I'll surely come back again as it's one of their faves and update my review. The ambience is relax the attention is active, so it sure is worth a stop. Dumplings here are the best I've ever had. We ordered them fried. I also liked the soup dumplings but be warned that they are messy. We were able to sit after about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. The sesame chicken I could have done without. Definitely will be back. You're not coming to Joe's Shanghai for the ambiance or service, your coming for the soup dumplings. Joe's has always been the NYC Chinatown go-to for soup dumplings. They are still very good, but I do think you can find better. Still very good and worth the wait to get them.\\n\\nThe Wanton Soup with pork, and the vermicelli soup with pickles are also solid. Joe's is a good place to baseline your soup dumpling level on. Come early and expect lines. They only accept cash so go hit up a ATM first. Famous soup dumplings. They moved from their original location. More spacious and updated then the original spot. Happy the AC was pumping during this hot July day. Soup dumplings was on point. Make sure to let it cool before you punch a hole in the dough to release that savory hearty heavy soup broth. I wasn't careful and the soup squirted all over my shirt and pants. Battle scars but worth walking around stained shirt and pants. We went on a Saturday morning for brunch. The place was empty. We realized after being seated that this was a CASH only place. How inconvenient! Had I known we would have gone to another place that took credit card payment.\\n\\nYou get menus to order. There isn't much of a dumpling selection. We asked the table next to us what they would recommend. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, the pan fried dumplings, sesame noodles and scallion pancake. Nothing amazing but it was good in its simplicity. I recommend going in with an open mind, cash and set no expectations. The food is simple and tasty.\\n\\nMy friend said that the place looks renovated. The design is simple and clean. Good lighting. Clean floors. Joe's Shanghai Chinatown Manhattan NYC\\n\\nThe wait time around 50 minutes to 1 hour on Wednesday (holidays weekdays) at around 6pm, also depends on how big is your party. Once the table ready and we sat down, everything flew pretty fast, ice water for each person was delivered without even asking, and they started taking orders as soon as we're ready, in 5-10 minutes the soup dumplings was served.\\n\\nWe ordered the pork meat soup dumplings \\u5c0f\\u9f99\\u5305, crab meat with pork meat soup dumplings \\u87f9\\u7c89\\u5c0f\\u7b3c\\u5305and pan fried noodles with beef \\u5404\\u5f0f\\u4e24\\u9762\\u9ec4. All food are super delicious, both soup dumplings, the best seller, are very juicy and flavorful, especially the crab meat one. Don't forget to order for take out for tomorrow's breakfast!\\n\\nThe restrooms located in downstairs. We didn't see any access for strollers or wheelchairs for restrooms, but you may asked the servers, if you need one. At this new restaurant, the restrooms are pretty decent, with 3 booths for women and 1 booth for men, also pretty clean, they might run out of toilet paper soon if they don't checked as often.\\n\\nOverall, we're happy to be back to this new location, and couldn't wait for another round!\\n\\n46 Bowery, New York, NY 10013\\nDaily 11AM - 10PM\\nWomen & Men restrooms are downstairs with several booth inside each restrooms.\\nthe dining area are accessible for strollers and wheelchairs but for the restrooms must ask the servers because they're downstairs.\\nstreet parking or parking garage close by next building\\n\\n#joesshanghai #joesshanghainyc #soupdumplings #chinatownmanhattan #nyceats #newyork\\n#newyorktimes #michelinrestaurants #zagatsurvey Listen. When you're in China town buying that purse and rolex.. save some money for the authentic Chinese food. This joint has it all and you will walk out a fat cat.\\nStop by before you are famished so you can get a number in line.. typical wait during that 4-5 pm is around 45 min.\\nGo here and find what you need. Took some friends visiting out of states to Joes for some soup dumpling and Peking duck and it didn't disappoint.\\nServices were good and friends loved the food. Win win.\\nJelly fish: 10/10\\nSpicy szechuan beef: 10/10\\nSoup dumplings: 10/10, def order the ones with the crab meat, less dry and more soupy, texture is also better\\nScallion pancakes: 3/10, dry and no scallion flavor. A little disappointed at this.\\nSaut\\u00e9ed snow pea leaves: 10/10\\nPeking duck: 10/10, the skin is crispy\\nOverall, glad Joe's lives up to their standards and my friends were satisfied. One of the best meals I've had in New York. The pork xiao long bao lives up to the hype. Will definitely visit again. Don't hesitate if you're in Chinatown.\\n\\nFood: 5/5\\nValue: 5/5\\nExperience: 5/5\\nService: 5/5\\nAmbiance: 5/5\\n\\nAuthenticity: 5/5\\n\\nRecommends: Xiao Long Bao, Spring Rolls\\n\\nNotes: Cash only. Go inside to get a ticket for the waitlist. *Still Cash Only*\\n\\nI've been back to Joe's a few times in person and their XLB always hits the spot whenever I'm having a fix.\\n\\n*WAIT*\\nWe came early on a weekday and there was no wait. Otherwise, you'll need to put your name with the hostess who will give you a number.\\n\\n*FOOD*\\nThe pork meat soup dumplings are always plump and flavorful (11.95 for 8 pieces). We also ordered the seafood pan fried crispy noodles which was very good, and felt the seafood portions were reasonable. Also ordered the fried dumplings (8 pieces) but would skip these and save more room to try other dishes as the dumplings were pretty lackluster. It was overly greasy and the skin was very thick.\\n\\n*SERVICE*\\nService was standard -- they do add an automatic 18% service charge no matter how large your party is.\\n\\nStill a good place to get soup dumplings, but everything else seems average. Love Joe's. Eat here with my friend anytime I visit the city. Always get the pork soup dumplings and whatever noodle entree we are feeling. Service is always super quick too. They only accept cash though, and have an ATM at the front. I love me some soup dumplings!! Especially when California has a bunch of hole in the wall dumpling spots.\\n\\nI heard all the hype around Joe's Shanghai so yes, I threw it on my itinerary and the boyf agreed. Came on a Thursday during lunch and was seated immediately. Cash only!\\n\\nWe got the iconic Crab and Pork dumplings to share.\\n\\nI love the idea behind crab and pork, but the dumplings we had were legit the most doughiest dumplings I've had with lack of filling. I was shocked that THIS is what everyone was raving about.\\n\\nThe dough was oddly dough-y. Way too much starch for my liking. Plus, they are pretty pricey dumplings and not that much filling to accompany it.\\n\\nHappy to have crossed it off my list, but nothing that made my toes tickle. No wait for 2 at 11:30 on a Saturday! Soup dumplings were of course amazing - but the chili sauce left a lot to be desired - it tasted stale and not very interesting. We also got the black mushroom with bamboo which I think may be my favorite vegetable dish ever. The soup dumplings were the highlight of the meal. The rest of the food was good as well. We had the eggplant with pork, which was delicious with a touch of sweetness. The seafood over crispy noodles had a great sauce that I have never tasted at a Chinese restaurant. The only problem was the staff made the whole experience a bit awkward as they hovered over us the whole time and after we finished eating literally gave us a death stare to get us to leave. It is definitely very touristy, but still good. I doubt I would go back though. It was a one time place. I couldn't remember when was the last time I went there, this time was to treat a friend in town because of its name. All the food we ordered including the soup dumplings were subpar, too doughy thick and hard on top, I've had better. Good for their business though, it's just a tourist cult and trap to me. Tried this restaurant out due to the good reviews online, & they certainly did not disappoint. Service was prompt and the food was delicious. The soup dumplings were fantastic (kudos to them being firm enough not to break when being handled). The rest of the meal was good enough to make us bookmark this place for a return visit.\\nA definite good spot to eat at whilst in Chinatown.\\n\\nNote: it's cash only - but there is an ATM inside. everything was superb! the soup dumplings are a must try, and i loved the bok choy. CASH ONLY! I had to come to one of the most popular soup dumpling restaurants in Chinatown. This place was super crowded on a Saturday evening. We had to wait over an hour to get seated even though the restaurant is pretty large. The service was pretty fast once we got seated.\\n\\nWe ordered the classic pork meat soup dumplings for $8. They were very good and hot. I still don't think they were worth the wait though. There are plenty of soup dumpling restaurants in Chinatown that are just as good. We also got spicy pepper salt calamari for $17 which was good but I wish it was crispier. We also got shanghai egg noodles stir-fried with beef for $17. There were so many noodles and beef.\\n\\nOverall, the portion size of everything was large, but I don't think the food was amazing compared to other food available around it. There are so many good restaurants with no wait in Chinatown. I was between 4-5 stars because the soup dumplings of course are probably the best I have had. Maybe Marks dumplings in DC and my son had some in LA but said those were the size of Hershey kisses.\\nThese were big and full of soup and the dumpling skin was not too thin or thick. The initial ones will burn your mouth so wait a few seconds. Perfect on a cold winter day. The broth is rich and full of flavor. We ordered 2 crab and one pork- I liked the crab better.\\nWe also had duck- it was good- a lot of skin and a little lean but the skin is our favorite part. The schezwN beef was very good but a little chewy. Fish was very good and the thick seafood noodles were great.\\nBut I thought the highlight was the dumplings Joe's Shanghai is one of the most popular Xiao Long Bao (XLB- soup dumplings) spots in Chinatown and for good reason. They moved from their original location a few years ago where you had to share a circular table with other diners ( which added to the dining experience in China town) but they maintain the same great food. The XLB are large and filled to the brim with soup in addition to being well priced. It is a must try when visiting! Outside of the XLB, Joe's also serves other classic Chinese dishes but the star has to be the XLB. Joe's is a cash only establishment and there is usually a 20-30 min wait for a table. They do also automatically add an 18% gratuity on top of your bill regardless or how much you order or if your party size. Overall, Joe's Shanghai is definitely worth the stop for their XLB, but make sure to bring cash! Get the xiao long bao, and nothing else! Joe's Shanghai has been bookmarked for years and I finally got a chance to try it after my third time in NY :).\\n\\nCame here before our Peter Luger reservation lmao but had to squeeze it in since I really wanted to try.\\n\\nWe didn't have to wait around 4pm and since the xiao long baos are so popular, when you're seated they already ask if you wanna place an order so they can start prepping them.\\n\\nWe also tried the Peking duck and maybe I'm a Peking duck snob but it wasn't good. The crepes they give you to wrap the duck were more like full sized tortillas. I'm used to crepes half the size, and much thinner. The Peking duck skin was good but the meat was dry.\\n\\nWould opt to just get the dumplings next time if we come back.\\n\\nCash only, of course! Really wanted to be wowed by this place but alas my expectations were too high.\\n\\nThey add an automatic 18% gratuity so there is less incentive for good service to be provided. Our waiter was so brusque and rude when taking our order. We felt pressured and rushed. He didn't understand English so I could not engage him at all.\\n\\nThe food is brought out in fast assembly like dumping slaw in a trough to hurry you out and make room for the next group of pigs.\\n\\nThe beef and broccoli was ok except the meat tasted a tad gamey. I did not finish it.\\n\\nThe pork fried rice was ok but lacked the traditional bean sprouts and i had to spit out a nervy piece of pork. We ordered:\\n+ Bok Choy: I needed some greens during my trip. It's not on the menu but they offer it.\\n+ Scallion Pancake: we could have done without this but it was so crispy and good. Since it was fried, this pancake filled me up in the beginning.\\n+ Pork Dumplings (XLB): These were the first XLBs I have enjoyed other than my favorite (Din Tai Fung). They are massive and hard to \\\"plop\\\" in your mouth. I made a mess several times; trying to open the dumpling, pour the soup in my spoon, or even just placing the whole thing in my mouth. It was a quite an embarrassing moment... but I looked at others and they too were also struggling.\\n+ Crispy Shredded Beef: hands down a favorite dish of the night. It came with a small side of broccoli which was nice for an added green vegetable.\\n+ Fried Noodles: This \\\"chow mein\\\" like dish was delicious. Super oily but filled with cabbage and chicken which was delicious.\\n\\nHubs and I clearly ordered more food than we could eat on our last night in New York. I wasn't really watching the food come out and assumed the plates were fairly small (comparing it to DTF). Yeah, no. These are fairly large family styled plates. I highly recommend to not order the amount we did unless you want leftovers. They packed our food really well and we were able to take it back home with us without any spills or even a smell. It warmed up well and tasted just as delicious.\\n\\nI recommend checking out Joe's Shanghai if you have the time. And by time, I mean roughly 30+ minutes to stand outside until they call you inside to wait some more until your table is ready. Cheers! This place amazes me - more because of its high ratings.\\n\\nThe worst service ever - servers staring at when you'll finish your food (lol) - we got the menu and the server immediately asked so what do you want- it was a strange service!\\n\\nComing to the food - the server cut the fried noodles so aggressively that it came flying on my face (of course no apology needed ;) his elbow hit us - again not bothered to apologize!\\n\\nAmbiance : loud chaotic and yet was being managed - no complaints here\\n\\nPayment : Those with credit cards beware this is CASH ONLY!\\n\\nWhich brings me to another very interesting point - they actually have two ATMS inside the property so you can take cash out!!\\n\\nIs that even permitted?\\n\\nEither ways - a v v bad experience and of course I'll never be back! Tons of places to eat in China town so don't fall for the one with most reviews and high ratings!! I will always come to this restaurant when I go to New York.\\nThe soup dumplings and pan fried noodles is a Must Have. The pan fried dumplings is good too!\\n\\nI found out recently they relocated to a bigger location. The inside looks very elegant and fancy now.\\n\\n*** CASH ONLY *** My first time at Joe's Shang hai. Had always heard good things and had to try it for myself! Prices were very good and the food is so filling. We ordered soup dumplings and scallion pancake. They give a lot and it really fills you up. Great service and short wait. Pretty good and highly recommend! Joe's Shanghai dumplings are hand-made, made to order, and slightly bigger than a golf ball.\\n\\nLocated in Chinatown at 46 Bowery, New York, this restaurant serves Shanghainese cuisine and is known for its soup dumplings (you probably know that at this point).\\n\\nExpect a wait at all hours of any day, but also know that they usually call you earlier than expected. You get a ticketed number. We were quoted 40-45 min and returned at 30 min; our number had already been called. This happened twice before as well (Yes, I guess we need to learn from our mistakes). This seemed to be the case for many others as well. I highly recommend the OS NYC Arcade Bar next door for a drink and games as a great waiting spot! Just don't take too long!\\n\\nThey have an extensive menu, and therefore something for everyone, from appetizers to main dishes, chef recommendations, noodles, fried rice, and all kinds of meats and vegetables. Oh, and you can't forget about the desserts!\\n\\nI highly recommend trying their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) and ordering those as starters for the table. We tried the pork ones (they also have crab and pork + crab). Imagine a dumpling larger than the size of a golf ball, filled with fresh minced meat and juicy broth seamed in a traditional bamboo steamer to keep the juices inside the soup dumplings moist.\\n\\n**TIP** for new soup dumpling eaters: do put the whole soup dumpling in your mouth when it comes to your table. The broth is most likely HOT, and it might burn your mouth. This has been my favorite way:\\n1) Put soy sauce and vinegar onto the plate with sliced ginger (this is your dipping sauce)\\n2) Take the soup dumpling and dip it into the sauce.\\n3) Then put the dumpling into your spoon, and bite a TINY hole in the wrapper of the dumpling to either 1) release juices on the spoon or 2) suck SOME of the juices out and then:\\n4) Finally, eat :)\\n\\nI've had a lot of soup dumplings in my life, and I would rate these a 4 out of 5. They're good because they do not leak and are tasty, though I would prefer a less fatty broth and thinner skin. For a tourist trap place, Joe's Shanghai is not terrible. That being said, I only got the soup dumplings - one pork and one crab - so I cannot attest to the other food. Honestly, the soup dumplings were pretty good and had lots of meat and soup inside, which is pretty surprising (most places skimp on the meat). The crab had an interesting flavor, and it's not bad, but I think the pork is definitely better. The pork soup was really good, even though I burnt my tongue on the first sip. The only complaint I have is that the skin of the soup dumplings were sticking to my lips every time I took a bite.\\n\\nThe other food looked kind of mid and was pretty expensive, but I don't know if you should expect authenticity if none of the other diners are Chinese. Also, this place is cash only and adds an automatic 18% gratuity, which is a little weird for bare minimum service. This restaurant is definitely geared towards tourists, but the interior is clean and the soup dumplings are pretty good. wow! must try. the dumplings is what brought me here and honestly was worth it. so flavorful and filling. get the pork and the pork and crab dumplings I've been to Joe's awhile back but then I moved from NYC so it had been a few years. Decided to take my dad here when we were visiting nyc again and for one thing wow it is in a totally new location. It's much brighter and bigger inside. We were seated quickly as we didn't mind sharing tables with strangers. The soup dumplings were still delicious. We got another noodle dish that I would not get again. Just come here for the soup dumplings and you will be happy. Overrated and not very delicious sadly. It's more for the tourists than the locals who want good food. Service is excellent as is the ambiance but the food has really gone downhill. Casual, soup dumpling shop in Chinatown. No reservations, we came on a Friday evening for 2 people, were sat within 10 minutes. The pork soup dumplings were delicious, a bit large but tasty. Also ordered the scallion pancakes which I would not recommend, a bit overdone and too crispy. Would recc for good food and casual vibes **STILL CASH ONLY**\\n\\nFirst time at the new location and it still slaps. My party of 6 came around 12:15 on a Sunday, and were seated by 1:45. I tried:\\n\\n+ Pork soup dumplings\\n+ Scallion pancake\\n+ Sesame chicken\\n+ Shanghai noodle soup\\n+ Young chow fried rice\\n+ Half Peking duck\\n\\nDumplings were a highlight as always, though the soup was also amazing - sleeper hit! Duck is also one of the better deals in town - you can get better quality at Hwa Yuan or Uluh, but the portion/price ratio is excellent here. Sesame chicken wasn't as good as I remember but it was still solid. The food was here was good with it being in China Town. There were a lot of options to get from the menu so I would advise looking at the menu online before coming. Also take a look at photos for added measure.\\n\\nThe service was not so good. We felt rushed the entire time. The wait staff does not check to see if you need anything after they dump your order at the table. They also do not have ice for water or sodas on a hot day in July. Overall I would come back because I liked the food, but I would lower my expectations for service with a smile here. It's a shame that smiling when serving has left the planet. The Peking Duck was so delicious. Delicious sauce, crispy skin, fluffy bread and scallions make it complete. The only small improvement could be if the duck were a bit more tender. Service is fast and nice. Very very good and would eat here again. Joe's is a classic Chinatown staple that is increasingly overrun by the tourist crowd. Lines are long - you can end up waiting over an hour on weekends - and while they have recently renovated the place, the seating is still not very comfortable.\\n\\nThe food is still uniformly good, there are no 'bad' dishes but also nothing that seems particularly outstanding or special. The soup dumplings are a must-try. I find the exterior of the dumplings are a little thicker than some of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants.\\n\\nThe servers are definitely overworked during peak times so it's hard to expect great service. Note for first timers, you may have to share a table with other patrons. The restaurant is cash only and an 18% tip is included in your bill. [Grade: A]\\n[Worth it ($)?: 8/10 - good price for great soup dumplings]\\n\\nTo be honest with you, I've never heard of Joe Shanghai but luckily my friend knew about this place. Let me tell you, little did I know my soup dumpling world was about to change.\\n\\nWhen my steaming hot soup dumplings arrived, I was immediately struck by their plump and juicy appearance. But it wasn't until I took my first bite that I truly understood why these dumplings are so highly regarded. The broth inside was simple yet amazing- rich, savory, and bursting with flavor. I couldn't believe how much liquid was packed into each dumpling, and I had to re-evaluate every soup dumpling I've had before.\\n\\nI poked the first dumpling in my spoon, expecting to drain all of the savoury juices, but it was more than double what I expected (JUST LOOK AT MY PIC).\\nAlso, we had gotten both type of soup dumplings (pork and crab), but personally I think I definitely prefer the pork version more.\\n\\nIt was this day I realized that I had discovered the best soup dumplings I had ever tasted. Joe Shanghai's attention to detail and commitment to quality truly shines through in each and every dumpling. But be warned - their soup dumplings are so good that you'll never be able to go back to mediocre ones again. It doesn't look like much when you walk past it, but the moment I saw \\\"soup dumplings,\\\" I had to sprint inside, and, gosh, it was the best decision I ever made.\\n\\nAfter a long day of walking 10k, this is a must go to place in New York Chinatown. Every dish was absolutely delicious, and, next time I go, I'll just be ordering the soup dumplings. They have a crab-pork soup dumpling mix and just a pork version.\\n\\nWhen you say soup dumplings, you may be thinking, \\\"okay, a little bit of soup,\\\" but, no, these are SOUUUPPPP dumplings! They're gushing with hot soup inside each dumplings. These were some of the best dumplings I've ever tasted!\\n\\nI recommend putting the dumpling in a spoon, making a small hole in the dumpling skin, drinking the soup, and then adding vinegar and soy sauce and eating the dumpling.\\n\\nThe catch for this is that you could only pay cash. But, if you know that the best Asian small shops only accept cash, then you'll know that this is definitely a catch!\\n\\nI'll be visiting New York again just for this! Delicious crab soup dumplings, the soup is very flavourful and fragrant! They were served nice and hot, in the bamboo steamer with a lid on top to keep the dumpling hot and helped prevented the dumpling skin from drying out.\\n\\nThe place looks to be recently renovated since it looked much better than the older pics of the place. The decor is very modern.\\n\\nI would definitely return for more crab soup dumplings the next time I'm in New York! I go here when I'm craving the pork soup dumplings. Good price and good sized soup dumplings with a lot of soup and meat inside. Eat it while it is still hot, it gets congealed when it cools down and looses its taste completely. I recommend going for lunch, there's always a long line around dinnertime and weekends. A revered place, a landmark that any visitor wants to check off the list. But the quality has dipped like the demand for peloton!\\nSoup dumplings are still a success, but everything else we ordered was a miss. Tasteless pork dumplings, veg dumplings are a joke, chewy scallion pancakes, underwhelming fried salt pepper fish.\\nFor all the demand this place disappointed. Everyone be sure to do not double tip! They have already charged you 18% service fee.\\n\\nThe soup dumpling was 2/5, quite disappointing with its thick layer of skin. The fried rice was pretty good though. Pretty solid place to get XLB. I like how there's no frills and long lines here. Too bad there's no glass windows to see them make the baos like din tai fung. There's tons of soup in the soup dumplings,so watch out when biting into them! We got the ones with crab filling and they were pretty, pretty good. I still can't figure out why they were orange on the inside. Half a Peking duck took 20mins to prepare and was pretty reasonably priced. The seafood noodles seem to be a Cantonese dish, so probably not the best to order at a Shanghai restaurant.\\n\\nIf you're Chinese, you'll be confused by the English translation of the store's name. Where is the deer shouting? Who is Joe?! There's a lot of white people eating here. It's cash only, so hopefully the IRS auditors don't shut it down for dodging taxes. Joe's is a fantastic restaurant. Table for 2? The restaurant sits you at a table for (?)people warmly sit together, showing me friendship to be or not? I always find other soup-dumplings. 16 Pell St -\\u300b for your feet, etc, then you cross the narrow street literally, and eat, and eat...! Delicious, perfect seasoning, never rushed! I wish they would deliver to Brooklyn! Easy enough to take home. One (1) train, all the way! Listen to , and in a click, you're in CHINATOWN. A DAY OF YUMMY FOODS@Joes, , A FOOT RUB at Heaven,. Extended to your wishes! 16 Pell Street is the start for your tired feet. Then, a meal of your choice!! You will never forget; you'll be back! I hope you love this \\\"day\\\" as much as I do!! So delicious! A great experience. Be sure to bring cash.\\n\\nWe had the soup dumplings, the beef with string beans, and the Shanghai fried noodles with chicken. What a feast! We really enjoyed each item and would have liked anything else on the menu, too, I am sure. The tables around us were buzzing and the restaurant filled up quite a lot while we were eating (so did we). The flavors were all so rich and full of umami. Yum, yum, yum! Get there early to be sure you get a table. We love Joe's Shanghai! We used to go to the Flushing location until it closed and this location is just as good! The ingredients are always fresh, from the broccoli to green peppers, and the ingredients great quality, beef, shrimp, and scallops. The sauces are always perfectly flavorful and seasoned.\\n\\nOne of my favorite dishes is the scallops and prawns in garlic sauce, the sauce is so very good.\\n\\nIt looks popular to eat indoors too (no outdoor seating) but we have only ever done takeout from this location. Takeout has always been pretty fast and well organized. I went here on the evening the day after my birthday. My father and I walked past here and decided it seemed to be worth a shot due to the critics reviews and Michelin approved status.\\nWe got the string beans and chicken, Peking duck and the soup dumplings. The Peking duck tastes good and the skin was crispy but it was lacking in flavor. The quantity was also sub par compared to other locations. The soup dumplings I had no complaints. The string beans were also very overpriced. We ended up spending over $80 on the three dishes. It made sense than none of the customers were Asians. This seems to be a place for tourists. This place is SUPER hyped up. So many features on different \\\"must eat lists\\\" but i was quite confused because I thought it was very average...\\n\\nOverall, good soup dumplings. I'd just order a bunch of those and maybe a veggie dish (we got eggplant, which was very good). The other dishes are average, and you probably can skip. I'm sure you can find better noodle dishes in Chinatown. I went to Joe's on a Holiday Monday right at opening. I did not have to wait. Service was quick. My husband and I ordered the pork soup dumplings, sesame chicken, and beef pan fried noodles. The pork dumpling was good but not great. It needed some salt and the texture of the pork was different than I've tried. The actual dumpling was good and there was enough soup inside. The sesame chicken was crispy and sweet. The beef pan fried noodles were very good as well. The beef was not overcooked. The noodles were soft and crunchy.\\n\\nThe inside was big. Some of the tables were close to each other.\\n\\nWould I come back? Maybe for different entrees but not the soup dumplings.\\n\\nCASH ONLY! Am I missing something. How does this place have so many good reviews. I only came here to try their \\\"famous\\\" xiao long bao and ended up with giant hockey pucks. The XLB was soo big it didn't even fit in the soup spoons. And the dough was so thick we would only drink the soup and eat the meat inside. The soup dumplings here are delicious! Be careful to load the dumpling into your spoon so you don't lose any of the soup! I tried both of the pork meat soup dumplings and the crab meat pork soup dumplings and I like the pork dumplings better. I tried a little bit of the Shanghai noodle soup which was great on a warm day. I didn't have to wait long during Saturday lunch time. Worth the wait! The soup dumplings were THE BEST! Whenever you come, get ready to wait because many come to enjoy the delicious dumplings and with good reason. The ambience was loud and tight, but all part of the experience. I would come here again, but definitely not when I'm already hungry because of the wait to be seated. *** 4.5 stars ***\\n\\nAfter complaining about how there's no good Chinese food in NYC (at least in the borough of Manhattan) I stand corrected. We ordered Joe's on Christmas Day and everything we had was excellent. I ordered online and made a mistake (accidentally ordering two eggplants) and wanted Moo Shu Chicken but the platform only offered pork, so I called them after placing my order and they were able to switch out the extra eggplant for green beans and switch the meat on the Moo Shu. The gentleman on the phone was very patient and helpful due to it being probably their busiest day of the year. He said that it would take a while due to how busy they were, but it was only about 35 minutes before our take out order was ready to pick up (even though the duck alone was supposed to take 40). We arrived to a huge crowd waiting outside for a table - great sign.\\n\\nFor 3 of us (and leftovers for many meals - they gave us serving ware for 10...):\\n\\nPeking Duck Half 30\\nSnow Pea Leave 20\\nMoo Shu Pork (Chicken) 19\\nShrimp Pan Fried Noodle 20\\nPork Dumpling (8) 12\\nEggplant with Garlic Sauce 17\\nSauteed String Beans 17\\nHouse Special Glazed Crispy Chicken 23\\n\\nThe duck was a great price and my only complaint is that the skin was a bit fattier than I would have liked. Definitely on the pricey side at ~$20 per dish including veggies, but this is NYC after all. Our favorite dish was probably the House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken - it had an orange chicken/ general gau's like sauce but was larger pieces of quality chicken meat than either of those dishes generally is.\\n\\nA definite NYC favorite! Such a lively place! Always full when we go, fast moving, getting you delicious food fast. We love loved the giant soup dumplings, so good! I've heard a lot things about Joe's! It's definitely an institution in NYC. I was excited to try them out and decided to order delivery on UberEats. Everything came packed well and hot. That was probably the only good part about the meal.\\n\\nWhat I tried-\\n\\nPork Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings):\\nThese were gigantic and came with 6 pieces which I thought was a great deal! However these had little to no flavor and were extremely greasy. For XLB/soup dumplings, I understand the fat helps with the juiciness and flavor of the dumpling/soup but this has literally no flavor. The vinegar it came with with also too sour. I ended up using vinegar that I had at home (the Lee Kum Kee brand) and that made it a bit easier to eat. Would not order these again.\\n\\nShanghai Noodle Soup:\\nYou get to pick what type of noodle you want for this dish but again, nothing helped since this was also flavorless. It was packed with veggies and shreds of pork but literally no salt, no spice, no seasoning. I honestly thought I caught COVID since I couldn't taste anything. The noodles were a nice texture and the pork had some flavor but that was it. I would not order this again.\\n\\nAgain, this was a to go order so I didn't go to the restaurant or see the inside or anything so I can't comment on ambiance. I was very disappointed with my meal though and I hate leaving bad reviews but this was a waste of time and money. There are better options in Chinatown. 2 stars since the food is edible. Hopefully they change things up and improve their seasoning. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were hands down the best I've tried! Add the chili oil and vinegar sauce, so flavorful! restaurant is to scam tourists - oily salty over priced food\\npoor service\\nalso be careful: cash only\\nillegally silently charges 18 percent to your check Went to try the famous soup dumplings. Honestly they were just as good as any other soup dumplings but still great. I do think the place is overhyped and we had to wait in line and take a number to get in This place was the first restaurant I visited in NYC. We waited about 30 mins to be seated. The food was delicious, very generous portions (definitely shareable). Great atmosphere and would definitely return! BEST \\\"fresh & salted pork with bamboo shoot soup\\\" in NYC or probably in East coast! They take time/ 40 min to prep/ cook this soup, compared to other places' almost instant- ready versions, even look at the color of soup, you will know the difference! As mentioned before, the wait can be very long so I recommend coming early or not coming super hungry so you try it out!\\n\\nThe service was quick and the servers were attentive. We got our food almost as soon as we ordered it, which is great since we had to wait a bit.\\n\\nThese are the first *real* soup dumplings I've had and they did not disappoint. We did two rounds - one pork & one crab seafood one. Both were so delicious!\\n\\nLoved the noodles and beef as well. The noodles were flavorful and full of veggies. They were soft and filling. The beef was crispy but not too crispy that it was straight fried which is always a thin line at restaurants.\\n\\nThe main thing to remember is to bring cash when you come here so you don't need to take from the ATM in front. So delicious and I recommend everyone try it! Amazing xiao long bao :) My husband visited this place a long time ago so we had such a high expectation as well.\\n\\nThis place is without a doubt. It already has high rating from great food. And it sure never changed.\\n\\nWe went in during early dinner time so didn't wait too long to be seated. It was very interesting to share table with strangers who we got to know.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of soup dumplings: pork and crab. We only tried pork. The filling meat was juicy and well seasoned. The broth inside was warm and mild. Absolutely loved it. I wish we had more time to enjoy them.\\n\\nHighly recommended! Came here at a whim for vegetable glass noodle soup, pork soup dumplings & vegetable steam dumplings after the gym with my close friend. I wanted her to try this spot since she's never really ate soup dumplings before. I came around 3/4. it wasn't busy, we've got seated pretty quickly. This spot is cash only and they add the service charge on the check, unless you are feeling generous you could add extra but not everyone knows that the service charge aka tips are already included cause they don't tell you. The decor inside is really cool. I think this place is a little overrated, there are definitely other better soup dumplings out there, this place is alright it's not the worst. it's still consistent. They do have two atms inside the spot before you get into the second doors. In my opinion I am just not a huge fan of the thick layer of skin on the dumpling, I think it would've been way better if the layer was just a thinner, but it's not awful. Pretty good place, fast service! We came for dumplings/dim sum but they don't have a large menu of this type. They had a few on the menu but they were just ok. It comes up in the search for dim sum but is a little misleading. The entree that we did order were very good, though! Not sure about the reviews or the line to get in. The soup dumplings lacked flavor as did the Shanghai noodles. Perhaps the food is bland for the tourist clientele. The \\\"sichuan\\\" oil on the table tasted like it was made from regular red pepper. Better Shanghai style on Mott street. Cash only and the tip is added to every check. We stopped by early on a Saturday evening. (Like 5pm) there was already a line and they told us it would be about 30-40 minutes. We ordered a drink from the bar nextdoor and waited. At the 40 minutes they sat us. Our server came right over and we ordered drinks. We order wine and sake. I would skip the wine next time....\\nwe ordered a chicken and vegetable dish as well as the soup dumplings!! Everything was so good but I can't stop thinking about the soup dumplings! They came out extremely hot and need to sit a while before you bite into them! They were so good.\\nWe ended up ordering an additional vegetable dish with mushrooms and bok choy. It was absolutely delicious! Our bill was very reasonable and we would 100% return. The part that was odd was that we were not assigned a server. It seemed all the servers took care of the tables. Overall it was great. When you are in Chinatown, this is a must try place at least once in your lifetime. I stopped in on Thursday right when they opened at 11am. It was the best decision I made in NYC to have not wait time and getting to be seated immediately.\\n\\nOnce we sat down, it didn't take that long for more customers to trickle in. Our server was decent but you don't go into Joes for the service. We only came in for the soup dumplings and ordered one of each (Pork and Crab & Pork). It took about 20 mins for the dumplings to come out, but once they did it was delicious.\\n\\nEach soup dumpling order comes in an order of 8 in a steamer basket. Each dumpling has actual soup to sip out and has a equal ratio of dumpling skin and meat. It's hard to find a good Chinese restaurant that will make this properly.\\n\\nThe only gripe I had was regarding the dumpling placements. It was difficult to grab some of the dumplings that were touching each other because we didn't want to pop or rip the skin.\\n\\nOverall, I wanna go to Joes every time I am in town! I really wanted to like it more than I did. It is a solid American Chinese restaurant and the food is similar to any take out you'd get in many, if not most, American cities. Unfortunately, that's not quite what we were looking for. The overall rating was quite good and there was a huge line to get in, so we thought that would be a good sign. The ambiance was casual, which was what we wanted. And the food was good, it just wasn't great. And for about $120.00/couple (for food and one beer), I really wanted it to be better. The one real negative point was our waiter. The hostess seated us with menus and he literally followed her to our table and asked if we were ready to order. We asked for a minute to look at the menu and he appeared annoyed and came back every minute until we were ready to order. He was very unfriendly and not familiar with the menu. It was a shame because the other waiters seemed friendly. I think I would have found the price to be a little more justified if the service had been better. All in all it was a fine, but not memorable, experience. FOOD - 3/5\\nThe portion sizes here are so generous, the xiao long baos were huge!! The food was okay, somewhat of a hit or miss because while the fried rice was super good, the taiwanese beef noodle soup was pretty bland.\\n\\nSERVICE - 4/5\\nThe restaurant had a ton of tables inside so we got seated immediately even if it was during lunch hour. The servers were super attentive and efficient. The only thing I would mention is that this place was cash only so make sure you bring enough!\\n\\nAMBIANCE - 5/5\\nThought the decor was veryyy nice for a casual Chinatown spot. Loved all the lighting inside and it felt so spacious even though many of the tables were filled. Surprisingly also had clean bathrooms which were much appreciated! This place came highly recommend to us and apparently many others as their line was out the door and it took nearly 30 minutes over their 30 minute wait estimation to finally get seated. We grabbed a drink at the bar next door while we waited but left soon after since it was hard to hear the hostess call out the numbers being seated (you get a numbered ticket when you arrive). We didn't see our waiter much, he pretty much just took our order and some other staff were tasked with delivering dishes and refilling waters. The crap meat soup dumplings were the best I've ever had and were served hot and loaded with a generous helping of meat! We were a little surprised to see the prawns were fried but they were still good and so was the sauce that they were in. The chicken noodle dish was a little bland for my tastes but was loaded with chicken and spinach, which I appreciated. We receive a sliced orange at the end of your meal which was a really nice touch! Overall it was a great experience and we'll be back probably just at a less busy time than the weekend to avoid the crowds. I used to love Joe's Shanghai. But this last experience was terrible. Utensils were all dirty and the Lion's Head and Pork shoulder had no flavor. Except a bit of over sweetness. As if they forgot to flavor it with the savory part. Had to ask for some soy sauce just to add some flavor.\\n\\nIt's gone so far downhill as to be not worth visiting. I would advise everyone to find another place for Shanghainese food. Very disappointed. There's a reason this place has over 6,000 reviews. Joe's Shanghai has been on my list for a while so two friends and I made it down on Friday afternoon. It was crowded when we arrived but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When you put your name in they give you a ticket with a number and then come outside to call your name. It's a cash only spot but they have atms on site.\\n\\nWe were seated towards the middle right by the kitchen with great views to people watch and amazing smells of what was to come. We all ordered different dishes along with sides of rice, and I also ordered the kung pao chicken to go. The veggie dumplings were excellent. Actually filled with a variety of veggies and glass noddles, you didn't feel like they were subpar compared to meat filled ones. The scallion pancake was also delicious and came out nice and crispy hot. It also included a sweet dipping sauce which paired great.\\n\\nMy favorite of the dishes was the shrimp and chicken in plum sauce. The shrimp and chicken was pan fried and tossed in the sauce along with the mushrooms and bamboo. The flavor was perfect and after my table had a taste, I ate the entire dish. The beef with scallions and onions also had good flavor and enough sauce to incorporate with the rice. The chefs special was beef with green onion and been sprouts. This dish was the spiciest and had amazing flavor. It was too spicy for me but I kept coming back to it anyway because it was that good. The kung pao was flavorful and came with cashews (my fav) and onion. On the medium spicy level it was delicious and included rice as part of the take out.\\n\\nIf you haven't been I highly recommend coming here to try the dishes and get a variety of options. Took my 17yo to NYC for a mom/daughter trip and goal was just to immerse in the NYC foodie experience. We did a walking tour of Canal and Yelp led us to this little gem. It was packed and we were seated immediately. Definitely a no fuss restaurant but servers were attentive, helpful and welcoming. The food was awesome but the soup dumplings? WOW, just WOW- full stop. I'm wrecked forever. Must try- cash only. \",\n          \"The food was delicious homemade pasta. The ambience felt like a nice restaurant with great service, attentive servers. We were able to reserve a few hours before our dinner time. Great cocktails too! We did a pre-theater search for a restaurant close to our theater...we were blown away. Service and food was spectacular. From the cocktails, to the carpaccio to the chicken fungi to the tirimisu. Everything was wonderful. We even had time to spare to make it to our show with plenty of time. We will be back. Thank you. While it doesn't appear to be the vibiest buzziest spot, this place feels like a classic. I read the reviews and saw some different opinions. I didn't expect the food to be so good. It's a comforting, familiar, home-cooked kind of vibe.\\n\\nWe got the carbonara and the rigatoni. Both were incredible. I especially loved the carbonara but the creaminess of that with the tartness of the rigatoni's sauce was to die for. The smokiness of that pancetta was truly delish.\\n\\nDon't expect crazy novel dishes, they do the familiar to perfection. A solid serving size, and a solid tiramisu too. Great service. And complementary bread with olive oil? Sign me up! Surpassed our expectations!\\nMy mom said it was the best fettuccine Alfredo she's ever had\\nI highly recommend tiramisu - i'm still thinking about it\\nPs don't get the clams Service - friendly & quick\\n\\nAmbiance - tight space, but overall nice.\\n\\nFood - delicious! I had the Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Grilled Chicken and it was so simple but yet so good! It wasn't watery, it wasn't rushed. It had good flavor too.\\n\\nDrinks - good!\\n\\nLocation - you cant miss this its right near times square! Such a nice opportunity to have in a busy area. Nice restaurant near Times Square and Broadway that makes you forget you're so close to the hustle and bustle outside. The food was a solid 3/5, a little salty for my taste but still a nice place for a dinner while in NYC. We popped in here to kill some time before our show, a lucked out by getting a place at the bar.\\nOur bartender was great! Helpful but not overbearing. Gin and tonics are my favorite so I was pleased to see that they had their own section of gin and tonics!\\nI had a delicious lemon one as well as a rosemary basil gin and tonic.\\nBoth were delicious, and made with fever tree tonic water which is the best.\\nGreat experience and hope to make it back one day to try some food! Loved everything s out this place. Service was impeccable. Loved my caesar salad and entree which was fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken. The chicken had a great flavor and was tender. Ended up getting desert too. Cheesecake was so good. Manager came by and all employees worked as a team. Was very impressed!! It's recommended you make a reservation but they take walk ins as well. Very small store front, walked right by it at first. The atmosphere is pleasant with recent hits playing in the background.\\n\\nThe servers are very attentive and have classy professionalism. It was impressive how they were all working together to handle all the tables.\\n\\nThe customary bread had a crunchy outside with a fluffy inside. Asked for a 2nd basket because it was so good. The calms for an appetizer were okay but would pass on. Ordered the Rigatoni Focaccia and it was delicious. Contains sausage and chicken finely chopped in it mixed with a creamy tomato sauce. The Fettuccine Alfredo was great as well.\\n\\nLovely place for a date night. Was lucky enough to snag a day of resy for a party of 7. Not far from midtown offices or from Broadway if you're visiting.\\n\\nNomz: Had the chicken parm and although the pasta looked like a small portion when it came out it was actually just wrapped up very tightly and turned out to be plenty for the piece of chicken (I am very big on perfect proportions). The chicken was wonderful, with the right balance of being thinly sliced without being too crunchy. It came with a generous amount of cheese and under it was a layer of sauce, which was an excellent touch. I ate it all, maybe pushed myself a little but had enough room to share a dessert after. Tiramisu was delicious, it was light and balanced in sweetness, loved it!\\n\\nDrinks: Had a bottle of rose and red, didn't get the names though but really enjoyed the rose!\\n\\nService: Was very good, waiters were kind and checked on us properly and dressed really nicely.\\n\\nAmbiance: It looked casual in the pictures (I was afraid it might be too casual) - but it was super cute! Cute decor and looked like a nice establishment while avoiding being stuffy. Not too loud but not too too quiet, great for business or a friends outing.\\n\\nNope or Dope: Dope, would definitely come back! Great restaurant before or after a play. The food was delicious. We ordered the seafood ravioli filled with shrimp, scallops and crabmeat in a white cream sauce and topped with crabmeat. My hubby ordered the chicken parmigiana. He enjoyed it. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. The marinara was so good. We split the large delicious Caesar salad and the ricotta cheesecake. The ricotta cheesecake is different than the traditional cheesecake, but it was good. The bread basket was filled with warm soft bread. Our servers were exceptional. They told us about the specials for the day with a thorough description of each. They also gave us recommendations for desserts. The restaurant is small and has an lovely ambiance! We will definitely come back and recommend to our family and friends! It is as Ok, definitely not great. Waiter was not on his game. Food was just meah. Not the greatest experience.\\nVery disappointing. Good vibe good wine and good food.\\nWe ordered a wine what waiter suggested and it was very delicious.\\nThe restaurant has an old traditional Italian vibe. Their menu can get kinda boring but the quality was good. The price is definitely higher than other places. Service was okay. The restaurant looked nice, was relatively empty, and has a romantic feel to it. The carbonara was actually insanely good, perfectly seasoned and creamy. We also got chicken parm with spaghetti and a rigatoni dish, which were both also tasty, but the carbonara was actually heavenly. Of course, good came with warm bread and butter. Trattoria Trecolori was a great choice before our Broadway show in New York. We were drawn to this restaurant by the positive reviews and its convenient location near the theater. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance, and our table was ready as soon as we walked in.\\n\\nAs we settled in, they promptly served us with a delightful basket of bread, and I ordered a sparkling moscato. The menu had so many options so it was a challenge to decide my main course, but I decided on the capelline alla putanesca. It was delish! The flavors were perfect, and it didn't weigh me down, making it an ideal pre-show meal.\\n\\nFor dessert, I got a mini cannoli. While it was indeed \\\"mini,\\\" it was the perfect, sweet bite to conclude the meal.\\n\\nDespite the restaurant being busy, the attentive staff and the pleasant atmosphere made our visit enjoyable. I'd certainly return here again. The food wasn't amazing but that was okay. The store was much bigger than I thought after I first entered I realize there was so much space further in.\\n\\nI got the calamari, magsinore, and risotto. This store had pretty good value because the portion sizes were huge and also they gave a lot of squid - lightly fried.\\n\\nHowever, I do have to say I had to ask the waiter for more lemon for our calamari, hoping that the calamari could have some more flavor.\\n\\nSlightly slow on service, and wasn't quick to refill water but they were quite busy. We were actually really full just from the bread and appetizer so I ended up packing my risotto to go. Great ambience of this place, loud and sectioned perfectly. We sat quickly with our reservation, and our server was always available for more water and bread.\\n\\nPretty good Italian cuisine, lacked a tad bit more bite to the dishes. The cocktail was very liquor forward with not much left to be desired. Had the ravioli with bolognese, the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti, and penne We made reservations to come here prior to our broadway show. Our show started at 8 and our reservations were for 530. We felt that this was a good amount of time and still allowed time for my friend to go elsewhere after dinner for a dairy free dessert.\\n\\nThe servers were friendly and our drinks came quick. I had a really good Cabernet that I enjoyed a lot. This place was very busy so it was quite loud just an FYI.\\n\\nFor our meal, I had the veal piccata. It was fine. Tasted as expected but nothing to write home about and I have had better piccata dishes before. Presentation wasn't the best either but oh well! For dessert I had the affogato which was very tasty. I need a caffeine pick me up and this definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nThey have a bathroom in this restaurant located at the bottom of the stairs and I don't think there is any other way to access it so if you have trouble going up and down stairs, just be aware of this. All I can say is WOW. I came here last night with my sisters and mom for a birthday dinner and it was a wonderful time.\\n\\nThe food was delicious, the ambiance was nice, but the service was exceptional!! We had Mitchell V. as our server and he was attentive, kind, friendly, and very communicative with us. He is probably one of the best servers I've had while on my trip in NYC!\\n\\nAs for the food - every single dish we had was 10/10, no complaints at all.\\n\\n- The Ravioli was one of their specials and it was a three cheese ravioli with sauce and was delicious\\n\\n- fresh yummy bread was given to the table but along with that we got the meat/cheese appetizer was a great choice prior to dinner.\\n\\n- the spaghetti carbonara was 10/10. Pancetta was delicious and they didn't skimp on the flavor and portion size.\\n\\n- Tiramisu - delicious. Get it, you won't regret it. We were excited to dine here and were happy that we were seated in the back in a large booth. Everyone was very welcoming and our service was good. The food was hot and delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There was a snafu with two of us getting the wrong dish, but it was remedied. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and all shared it. It was delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here for authentic Italian food. 3.5\\n\\nThis place was GOOD. I wasn't blown away but everything was above average and the portions aren't too big but bigger than the usual pasta serving you'll get at a fancy restaurant. They have vegetarian and vegan options as well on the menu. The service was great and we got our food very quickly. The inside of the restaurant is quite large, cozy and warm. I'd recommend if you're in the area. Very Good Excallent Food and Excellent Service. Great place to eat and bring some beverages. We went in between shows without a reservation. Even though we didn't have a reservation, they were very accommodating at the bar. The bartender did not miss a beat, making drinks for the servers and waiting on everyone at the bar along with greeting guests as they walked in the door to direct them to the host stand.\\n\\nOur food was great and if we had more time between shows, would have tried dessert too, but couldn't be too full or we would probably fall asleep in the show lol. Went on a Sunday for lunch. Nice crowd having an afternoon glass of wine. I had their seafood ravioli, which was the special of the day, and my husband had their prosciutto di parma sandwich. His was ok, but obviously just a sandwich... Mine was out of this world good. I'm not sure I'll go back and not get their ravioli. The dough they use is sweet and al dente. Wait staff was excellent as well. They talked us in to dessert. After a long day of sightseeing and walking, I and a group totaling (4), decided to get Italian for dinner. Boy was it a great decision to choose Tattoria Trcolori over some of the other options in the area. I called it and made sure we had a reservation in case the restaurant was busy (seeing how it was a Saturday night). The front desk was very helpful and ensured we would have a table when we arrived. Shortly afterward (~15 minutes of walking) we arrived and were seated within 5mins. The decor was very modern Italian and, if you walked in, you would have the assumption that Italian would be on the menu. The staff was very attentive and very good at making sure our water glasses were filled at all times along with our wine. We went the route of ordering a bunch of food and ate it family style which can never go wrong if the food is good. Let me tell you, the food was amazing. We ordered the I Rigatoni, Tavola Trecolori, Carpaccio Di Manzo, Tortellini, Linguine Nere Alla Monsignore and the Risotto Mare E Terra. Understandably when you order that much food, Pellegrino, and two bottles of red wine, your expectations would be a pretty hefty bill, especially with the restaurant located in Manhattan. Surprisingly the bill was very reasonable for a party of four, not only do you not spend the outrageous prices expected from a manhattan restaurant, but you also get delicious food! Needless to say, whenever we are in town and craving Italian, we will be coming back! Great place in the city for some Italian food. My friends and I came here for my birthday last month and we had a great time. We started with espresso martinis and the antipasto with Caesar salad and fried mozzarella. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. My linguine a la vongole was as expected. My favorite part was dessert. I got an affogato and the plate said happy birthday on it. All in all it was a memorable trip. Decent enough tourist place one block from Times Square. Appetizer came out fast but entrees took another 40 minutes on a weeknight. The food was all pretty good but I wouldn't say it's as good as all these 5-star reviews indicate. Everything was very salty and lacked finesse. Squid ink pasta was so salty that it overpowered the squid ink. Spaghetti carbonara was nicely al dente but also way too salty. The pappardelle was my favorite as the house made wide ribbons had a good texture that complemented the meat and mushroom sauce nicely.\\n\\nAn overall good place for a casual tourist expecting a nice, but not fancy meal. This is a non traditional Italian restaurant. Our options were limited at 9:30PM. The food is pretty good but they lack a couple things to be a traditional Italian restaurant-seasoned dipping oil for your bread was unavailable.\\n\\nWe got a salad to split, the rigatoni pasta dish and one of the veal entrees. Everything was good but on the salty side. The food came out very quick and service was prompt. The prices were average for New York.\\n\\nI wouldn't go back but that's because there's so many other Italian options in New York! Dinner before a play\\n\\nENTRANCE - the host station is inside a bit. When you walk in the bar is on your right. Keep walking in and host is on the left\\n\\nDECOR - very nice a mixture of modern and homey wood and brick. A good number of tables but in the heart of the theater district so you'll need reservations\\n\\nPARKING - none on the street really but a few garages close.\\n\\nMENU - a very nice spectrum of choices. They have gluten free pasta if you need this dietary option.\\n\\nAPPETIZERS - I had the misto salad with dressing on the side. It was very good\\n\\nENTREES - the Ny strip was decent but a tad bit stringy. The pasta dishes are good I was told.\\n\\nDESERT - try the tartufo ice cream. Exceptional\\n\\nPRICE - I didn't see the check but from menu it's between $$$ and $$$$ Ordered linguine de vongole to go. Clams were small and were a bit sandy. Service was mediocre, my order was completed put on a table, and it just sat there for a bit before they handed it to me. It was decent place because it was right next to where I was staying, that said I wouldn't travel to eat here again. Background: mid 30s business traveler, solo\\n\\nAbsolutely delightful dinner, served by an incredible staff. This was my first time here, and will absolutely be back.\\n\\nService was impeccable. Entire dinner was fully served in less than an hour with no reservation. YUM! Excellent choice for service, ambiance, & most of all the food! I would recommend any of the chicken dishes and the house pasta sauce is excellent! They were very prompt with service, prudent with allergies, charged a reasonable price for the portion size and the food tasted great. The ambience was a little noisy, but felt family style and homey. Would recommend. We had a last minute dinner reservation at the restaurant for 8:30p on a Sunday and they were very accommodating. The joint is tucked away next to the Broadway theater and seems unassuming at first. Walking in, the interior feels homey, brick walls line the restaurant with a bar area to the left and tables in the back. It was a lot more spacious than I thought.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately, menu had a nice option of different pasta dishes, appetizers, meats, and drinks. We opted for just sparkling water, a few apps, and pasta dishes for each of us.\\n\\nI ordered the soup of the day (cauliflower soup) and the carbonara. The soup was perfect for a cold day, creamy and smooth, it tasted almost like a cream of cauliflower soup. Fresh green plump peas were at the bottom providing a nice texture contrast. With a bit of fresh cracked black pepper, it was the perfect app. The carbonara was honestly one of the better ones I've had, the sauce was rich but not too heavy, lardons were fatty and had a nice bit of funk/cure. My only complaint is I wish the dish came with an egg yolk and the pasta was a little firmer than I would like.\\n\\nI do want to give a shout out to our server Carlos. He was a real fun guy to be around, and helped us navigate the menu. A few of us were traveling from Japan and needed some recommendations on what to get. He was a real treat to have. Really enjoyed this Italian restaurant in Midtown! Took some photos mid-bite, got a little sidetracked on the food and atmosphere.\\n\\nStarted off with two appetizers: baked clams and fried calamari. Not a big fan of clams but these were very fresh and the stuffing was a great pair. We always order calamari when dining at an Italian restaurant but I will say they were just average. Had higher expectations but thankfully it came with shrimp and vegetables which were excellent.\\n\\nMain courses were gnocchi with vodka sauce and spaghetti carbonara. Gnocchi was AMAZING! The cubes of mozzarella cheese mixed with the rich gnocchis were phenomenal, definitely one of the bests I've ever had. Carbonara was also a great choice.\\n\\nFinished with a classic cappuccino and ricotta cream cheesecake. Cheesecake was clearly not fresh and dry but still quite tasty! Overall this was a great find and the staff were very accommodating despite being very busy. We started with some wine--good selection we thought and went with individual glasses as we like slightly different wines.\\nShared a caprese salad that was very good. The burratta was very fresh.\\n\\nMy wife had ravioli bolognese and I had the lasagna bolognese. Both dishes were terrific. Sauce not overly salty, and veal really nicely done.\\n\\nEnded with a decaf-cappuccino and shared tiramisu and canoli. Don't skip dessert! It was really good.\\n\\nService is good. They give you whatever time you want. Not pushy. Knowledgeable about the dishes.\\n\\nPlace is a bit loud, could use noise dampening but did not cause any issues.\\n\\nThis place is a two thumbs up. I think we paid like $160 for all of the above (4 glasses of wine too). Amazing food. We ordered a variety of items for the table, and all were delicious. My only complaint is that they did not have cheese or seasoning on the table to mix with the oil for bread, but they did bring it immediately when requested. So no big deal.\\n\\nThey had a good variety on the menu, so there is something for everyone. Staff was extremely attentive. Service was prompt. Restaurant is clean. I would come back here for sure, or stop by if you are visiting from out of town. They are priced very reasonably for the quality of food. So I got food to go but I have to say I waited in the restaurant for a minute and the atmosphere was great I highly recommend eating there I was just too tired I was on a business trip. The hostess was great she recommended a great entree the bolognesa and it was outstanding and I had a salad which was actually quite a large salad. This is a very nitpicky thing but they're to go plastic silverware (which understanding in hotels is important) was not sufficient to eat the heavy- ness of the bolognesa maybe they should up the plastic silverware sturdiness This trattoria in the heart of the theatre district is precisely what it advertises: retro Italian food, comfortable interior, efficient service that will get you to your play on time. We asked for a window table & were given exactly that--high up on stools, which was fine, and perfect for watching the New York groove passing by. Service was attentive and pasta perfectly cooked. It's not haute cuisine but it's exemplary for what it is. We tried the squid ink pasta and the seafood risotto. Both were delicious and there was lots of seafood in both dishes! Portions were also pretty big too. The only weird thing was the bread was served with packaged butter? It truly pains me to write this review as this was one of my go-to restaurants for 5 years. I had a reservation for 5 people before a show and showed up early. When I walked in, I noticed the health code score said \\\"grade pending\\\", which was unusual. I've eaten here plenty before and it was always an A.\\n\\nI sat down at the table and something kept nagging at me to check why it was grade pending. I immediately went to Yelp (which pulls in health code scores, FYI) and saw that it was most recently rated a Z. A Z as in zebra!!!!! I didn't even know that scores went that low!!!\\n\\nI read why and saw that they found rodents in the kitchen. I almost vomited. I immediately knew I couldn't eat there, so I went up to the host and told them I would like to cancel my reservation. Fortunately no one in my party had arrived yet, and they hadn't started serving me.\\n\\nI ended up eating next door (which had an A) and it was great. RIP Trattoria Trecolori- you were one of the greats! It was really a good surprise. The place is simple but the food was honest and very good. It was really busy, so the waiter forgot about us. We also didn't appreciate much the desserts. In any case I think it is an excellent choice for a pre/post theater meal. Absolutely nothing I didn't like about this place, but also the food wasn't mind blowing like a lot of other New York restaurants I've been to! Great little Italian spot near Times Square! I was worried this would be a subpar restaurant that was close in proximity but it was actually decent.\\n\\nWe split an order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza between the two of us and it was crispy on the outside and gooey cheesy on the inside.\\n\\nFor the main dish, I couldn't decide between a few dishes and at our server's suggestion, I went with the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and it was amazing! We actually stopped in for a very early dinner, around 4pm, and I finished the whole plate. It was perfectly salty from the pancetta and creamy but not dripping in sauce. My friend got the Fettucine Alfredo and she said it was very good!\\n\\nGreat spot close to Times Square; highly recommend it! Rush, Rush, Rush...a staff mantra????????\\nThere's enough time to catch the train to Hoboken. Leave enough time to savor the flavor of Trattoria Trecolori ... if the staff lets you. INSIST...too many savory flavors not to stay and enjoy. Maybe New York types insist on quick meals off to the theater. But, here you'll want to sit back and take it all in over one of their meals...any one. We decided on a veal dish and bolognese which we requested be split in the kitchen to share. They were delivered individually with extra plates and utensils for US to serve. HELLO!?! We're here for service and food. Not your best start to a meal...Train your staff well. It will return it well. Back to the food, al dente vegetables, tender veal, sizable portions all delicious recalling prior excellent Trecolori meals. However, the best was saved for last...seriously, for dessert they offered a mini canal...seriously for $3.00!!! Putting the evening OVER the top. We went here for my birthday, prior to a Broadway show, and it was delightful! The service was excellent. I ordered the seafood salad and chicken marsala. The portions were large and perfectly cooked. My husband ordered chicken parmesan. For dessert, he ordered pistachio turtoffo and I got chocolate mousse cake. It came with a candle. The staff almost sang \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" but I asked them not to. The prices are moderate for where the restaurant is located. Nice place, not crowded for lunch (on Monday). Good variety of Italian food and especially wines. So my friend and I came in to have dinner before he had to go back to work at the theater.\\nWe were greeted by a guy who I believe was the manager, and he asked if we had a reservation.\\nwe didn't and he seemed annoyed.\\nHe looked around the empty restaurant And sat us at a side table near the bar.\\nAt this point, Gene was our waiter. We ordered two espresso martinis with grey goose vodka.\\nGene didn't seem like he wanted to be at work that day. He wasn't warm and I definitely didn't feel welcomed by his presence.\\nso I was happy after he had asked us 1 time if we wanted to order and we still weren't ready even though it had only been about 10 minutes, so the next waiter, who came was super nice and Very friendly, warm smile and made us feel welcome! It was strange, because I think Gene gave our table away because he was still working serving other tables.\\nMy friend ordered veal Parmesan. We split a Caprese and I had a side order of pasta with marinara sauce.\\nI loved that the bread was warm. The butter was good. The bathrooms were clean. It got crowded a short time after we arrived so I understood why you need a reservation.\\nOverall experience was a 5\\nOur 2nd waiter I believe his name was Carlos.\\nhe again gave great service!\\nThe hostess and the guy who I think he's the manager definitely doesn't seem very interested in their gas and looked rather bored.\\nThe food was good .\\nThe martini was great .\\nWhat I return probably not . Sat here at the bar for dinner before a show, and the place was packed. I liked the different flavors of gin and tonic and ordered a cucumber one which was good. I started with a Caesar salad, but then the waiter never asked me if I wanted anything else. When I got his attention and ordered it, it came out pretty quickly, but he just wasn't really proactive about checking on me. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, which was fine, but the sauce was a little runny. For a Caesar salad, chicken Alfredo, a glass of wine, and gin and tonic it was $78 plus tip. What a great spot to try! I'm glad we decided to come. Cute inside we just sat at the bar. To start the martinis are delicious. I had the side of bolognese and it was a perfect amount for me. My fianc\\u00e9 got the vegetable linguine to me it didn't have much flavor but he enjoyed it. The bartender was nice and good service. This place has great vibes, you're thrown in the middle of New York and Rome vibes. The food was good, the interior was nice and clean, but the service takes this place to another level.\\n\\nDecor-simple accents remind you you're in NYC, but also give you a sense of a Roman restaurant.\\n\\nService-the staff here are amazing. They are very attentive and serve you with a smile. You could tell they take their job seriously and it shows.\\n\\nFood-we tried the chicken Alfredo and Chicken parm sandwich. The Alfredo sauce was creamy, cheesy, and tasty. The chicken parm was very good, the baguette type bread was soft and moist on inside and the chicken was very flavorful and tender. I would've liked a bit more sauce, but still great. The portions are good and you leave full. We were seated very quickly, even without a reservation. The staff is kind, food is delicious (!!), but don't expect the waiter to check in on you. You'll need to flag someone down if you need anything. I had the ravioli special (three cheese ravioli with bolognese sauce) and my kiddo had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. Restaurant is clean and has an old-charm vibe. Seemed to be a mix of tourists and locals. I came here without a reservation before a show and was able to walk right in. The list of extensive gin and tonics was fun, and they have lots of cocktail and wine options! We didn't get an appetizer because we were kind of on a time crunch, which we made sure to tell our waiter. He said no problem, and we immediately put in our order. After almost waiting 45 minutes, our pasta dishes finally came. We ordered the penne arrabbiata and the spaghetti carbonara. I personally liked the penne better as the flavor of the sauce was nice and spicy but not too heavy. The carbonara was essentially just loose heavy cream and bacon on top of pasta. I couldn't eat very much of it due to how heavy it was. We had to eat as much as we could in 5 minutes as we were rushing out the door to get to our show. Not the most enjoyable dinner experience. We went here pre-theater. We had a great time and the service was excellent. A neighboring table got the fried veal shank with salad and that by far looked to be the best. The b veal piccata was good but not my favorite. The Alfredo was light and delicious. Pasta is homemade and delicious. This was a huge treat! The squid ink pasta with seafood was absolute perfection. I enjoyed a couple of different gin and tonics from their fun menu of creative pairings, and my affogato was the thing dreams are made of!\\n\\nService was impeccable. I had a late lunch here on a Thursday. I had the pappardelle pasta which is not on the menu on their website. It came out warm but not warm enough to melt the cheese grated on top. I wish it was hot. I found the meat a bit dry. Good came out fairly quickly. It was okay overall. The service was very good. They didn't rush us and were accommodating when my friend wanted something not on the menu. She wanted something with strawberries so they gave her strawberry and cream. The decor was nice also. The food is outstanding! I had gnocchi dish, WOW, amazing! Serving sizes are more than enough, I shared mine, and still couldn't finish it all! The wait staff are very helpful and so friendly. Thank you for a lovely early lunch this afternoon! This is a great Italian spot! And right next to a bunch of Broadway shows.\\n\\nThe squid ink dish is so good, the seafood fresh, and the sauce flavorful.\\n\\nThe salmon is amazing! The white wine caper sauce is so good with the free bread and the mixed vegetables are well flavored and a generous size.\\n\\nThe tiramisu is great! My husband has a more bitter palate and liked it but it wasn't his favorite. I thought it was great! Omg this meal was so gooooood!! I went here as a group of six for my birthday. We shared two appetizers which were both really tasty and cooked perfectly. We all ordered a pasta dish. The linguine had a good amount of clams and was Al Dante just how I like it. The service was amazing. Waiters constantly came to check on the table and refill bread and water. The interior is also so beautiful and comforting. I'm coming back for sure! This is a cozy, comfortable spot. It feels like a place you have been before and has something for everyone. The desserts were 10/10 - highly recommend the chocolate mousse and tiramisu. Good, reasonable and pleasant spot in the theater district for solid Italian. Nothing that special but good and satisfying. We made reservations and arrived 10 minutes early. They seated us right away. Super friendly staff, great wine. The food was great. We got the tiramisu for dessert and it didn't disappoint. Service was lovely! Very attentive but not too fawning. Food was fantastic, very tasty --right in the heart of the theatre district. Will definitely be back. We had the linguine with clam sauce; (the best we've had); spaghetti carbonara (again the best we've had) and the risotto was flavorful and delicious The best place we went to on our trip, so good we went two nights in a row! The spaghetti bolognese was by far the best I've had. The restaurant is quaint and small but worth the wait! Make a reservation, you won't regret it! The food and service were good. Prices were reasonable for Times Square.\\n\\nThere take on the Pima Cup was probably the best I have had outside of New Orleans. Great food, nice ambiance, friendly staff. Highly recommended. Will definitely come back Wonderful Italian spot in the Theater District! My family and I had spent a long day in museums and were super ready for a big meal. We were able to grab a table for 7 without a reservation by beating the dinner rush a little bit.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was delish and I have zero complaints. The complimentary bread was warm, super soft and airy with a good crisp edge. We ordered the frutti de mare \\\"salad\\\" to share and all the seafood were tasty. For entrees, we had a carbonara, two veal dishes, lasagna bolognese, seafood squid ink linguine, and the gnocchi. The veal for both dishes were tender and juicy. The lasagna was so yummy! Lots of ragu and fennel sausage. I liked the gnocchi as well, which was a vegetarian dish with fresh mozz and eggplant. The gnocchi weren't as fluffy as I'd like and is the least favorite entree for the group, but it still was not bad.\\n\\nWith so many Italian restaurants around town, it can be difficult to narrow it down. I know I had difficulty choosing but we're so glad we chose this place and may return on another visit to NYC. Dinner on Jan 25 before the theater. Best dinner we had all week, and we had some great food. Service was first rate - professional, attentive without hovering, everyone doing their job in a way which made you feel as if there were no other diners. No doubt, if you are in this neighborhood you need to dine here. Amazing food\\nThe pasta to chicken parm ratio is a little off but it's okay! Would recommend. Food came 10 mins after ordering. They charge 8 for tap water. Great ambiance !! Wonderful food and service - a beautiful breath of fresh air in the midst of chaotic NYC! 3.5 stars - I love the Times Square area for theatre and shopping excursions but finding decent and not overly priced food is a mission in itself. However, I happened to pass by this lovely Italian restaurant on my way to 8th Ave. After some marathon shopping, everyone in my group was tired and hungry. Finding a cuisine was just as challenging when you're with kids of all ages.\\n\\nHalf my party was present and the other half was on the way. The staff was very kind to seat me anyway. Luckily too, as it seems the tables were getting filled up for the dinner rush after I sat down. It was a little past 6pm. We were brought water and warm toasted bread within minutes. Our waiter was super quick to drop off menus and to check in on us when the rest of the party arrived.\\n\\nI noticed the classic penne a la vodka was not on the menu but it was something we wanted. So I asked our waiter if they had a similar dish - he said not a problem, they will just make it for us (and no, there was no similar dish). But it was so nice of them to make it - and it was good. We also ordered the Mozzarella en Carozza, lasagne, a side of mixed vegetables and an order of french fries for my kiddo. The lasagne was really good - two meats (beef and sausage) so that was a pleasant dish. The rest were just okay. And while the mixed vegetables were actually quite good (in flavor), it lacked a finished appearance. It was as if someone just plopped it onto the plate. So no points here for presentation. Once we got our food, service seemed to have been less attentive but they also were quite busy by then. It was fine, we just wanted refills on our water.\\n\\nOverall, the restaurant was clean and the food was decent. There was nothing memorable in particular but the prices were fair for this neighborhood. The food was very good, well prepared and very flavorful. Their staff is very friendly and professional.\\nThe next time I visit New York I will definitely return, best Italian Cuisine I've ever had hands down. Solid Italian food at a convenient location near Times Square. Service was good and food quality was consistent all around. None of the dishes disappointed. Albeit some had minor flaws. Such as the veggie sides for the veal which seemed more like an afterthought. The veal itself was soggy. However it was well seasoned and packed with flavors.\\n\\nPrices are about par for what you would expect for the area.\\n\\nIf you're craving some Italian while in the area or before a show, they're worth giving a shot. Don't expect to be mind blown but at least you know you didn't waste your calories! Many times heading to Broadway, you're looking for a good restaurant, but wind up disappointed. Even if the food is good, many places rush you so much, it ruins the dining experience. We were so happy to find that Trattoria Trecolori was just the delicious Italian restaurant we were looking for! Not only was the food fantastic, but so was the service.\\n\\nThere were 4 of us at this meal and we enjoyed everything....the food, drinks, ambiance, and customer service were first rate. For starters, we shared a Caprese salad while some had soup. Entrees ranged from Chicken Milanese, sirloin steak, to my Linguine Nere Alla Monsignore, which was squid ink pasta with calamari, shrimp, scallops, and more! Delicious! Finishing the meal with ricotta cheesecake and cappuccino was perfect!\\n\\nOne side note...the cocktail I had was so good! It was a gin and tonic called the Perfect Lemon, made with Malfi Limone gin...wow!!\\n\\nSo if you're headed to a play, or just hanging out in the Theater District, give this restaurant a try! You'll love it!\\n\\nCheers!! This restaurant was a random find and boy am I glad we listened to the people who reviewed on Yelp. The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable, I wish I had taken a picture. Beautiful exposed brick walls. Loved it\\n\\nThe food was OUTSTANDING. I tagged what each is in the pictures attached. They were plated so nicely also. The servers were super helpful with questions and were also very accommodating for allergy chances that were needed.\\n\\nWe will definitely be coming back to this restaurant again in the future because we enjoyed the experience a lot. Definitely recommend if looking for an Italian restaurant in the city. The service was wonderful. So was the lasagna bolognese. Very kind staff and accommodating. Food was okay. Caprese salad was dry and had no olive oil or balsamic on it. The mozzarella and tomato was fresh but it was practically flavorless. Fantasia chicken dish was okay. Pasta and sauce was good but the chicken had a weird texture and had that bad flavor that chicken gets when you microwave it. Bread was also plain. Service was good and wine was good. This place is a beautiful little Italian place. A nice stop if you're about to go to a show on broadway or just passing through. The service was great. I came with my family so it was a party of 7 and we had a nice server who was very accommodating with the things we asked for. I had the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was amazing breaded and seasoned well. The pasta however was very bland and I didn't really enjoy it. My mom had the pesce del' giorno. She said she loved it. The fish was cooked well and the sauce went well with the food and gave the fish a lot of flavor. My aunt had the fantasia and loved it as well. She said it was delicious and a good sized portion. My girlfriend had the rigatoni. She said it was good and seasoned well but thought the sausages could've been cut so it wasn't so much to chew. Overall I think it was a great place with good service the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was because my pasta was so bad. Otherwise everything else was great! Really really good! We came in out of the rain to grab apps and some warmth! We did not know we were at a hidden gem of an Italian restaurant in NYC. We were staying at the W and it was a close cute small place to dry off. The food was incredible. I'm pregnant and loved everything! Even though I'm. Very picky right now. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. Such a wonderful personality and really enjoyed his company. We got the French fries (the best I've had in a long time), the minestrone soup, the fried. Mozz (incredible flavor) and a caprese salad. Honestly if we didn't have reservations that night, I definitely would have tried the tiramisu! Look homemade and amazing! Not a spot to miss. We were soaking wet and they gave us concerned looks coming in, but the service and food was wonderful. Nice rustic Italian restaurant in the theater district NYC. Fair prices, great service, and good food. Old school. Beautiful lunch. Ariel our waiter was lovely. So many gluten free options. Great spot for a pre theater show. Booked a day of reservation and super glad we did! All staff was very friendly and provided awesome service! All our food was delicious. Drinks were tasty. All around great experience! Went to see Come from away on Broadway ( what a great, heartwarming show! Hurry it's closing soon on Broadway! ) Dinner reservations for six at my theater district go to restaurant trecolori\\nMy friends first time here and everyone was very happy! Chicken parmigiana! Veal with mushrooms! Lasagna with sausage and eggplant parm hero! Service is excellent as usual, atmosphere great! We arrived earlier than our reservation time and they seated us immediately without issue\\nDeserts were ricotta cheese cake, tiramisu and cappuccino - food was excellent as usual! Prices are reasonable for the theater district, service is friendly and very attentive! ENJOY! Service was not good. Multiple people performing different functions and the waiter did not take much responsibility. Also slow in bringing out food. Quality of the food was mediocre. Some aspects of the food were cold. Would not repeat My wife and I went here for dinner last night. We went early prior to seeing a Broadway show and did not have a reservation, but I would highly recommend one as it was really busy. Great atmosphere and service. Our waiter Mitchell was excellent and very attentive. My wife had the risotto, which was very good and there was a lot of it. I had the squid ink pasta with seafood (there was a fancy name for it, but it escapes me) which was also plentiful and very good. I would highly recommend it and we will be back. Wanted to try this italian spot as there were so many reviews! Disclaimer our party ordered takeout which may have reduced the quality we experienced.... in terms of slightly soggy foods.\\n\\nWe ordered the calamari appiterizer to share which came with quite a lot of food but considering it was a $20 dollar app I think it was well portioned. Really enjoyed that they included fried zucchini and peppers to provide some veggies to the meal. Additionally the marinara dipping sauce made for a yummy dunk for the calamari and shrimps.\\n\\nThe seafood squid ink pasta came with a good portion of seafood with three big clams, shrimps, scallop chunks, squid, and mussles. We found the squid ink pasta to be a bit mushy but we've noticed this may be a squid ink tradeoff? The noodles stuck together and the sauce did not really clingy to the noodles.\\n\\nWe did think the carbonara was a pretty solid pick. Although our one qualm was it was a tad salty but this was an overarching theme of the pasta dishes. Each order came with bread which we found a bit hard but yummy once dunked in some extra pasta sauce.\\n\\nOverall, the portions are quite large and perfect for sharing but that comes with a increased price tag. My go-to spot in midtown/theater district. Excellent food & service, very reasonable prices and you can get in and out for a show if you need to (let the waiter know if you're not on your way to a show!) Complimentary olives & good bread, portion sizes are perfect. Amazing Italian cheesecake! We were pleasantly surprised! We were looking for a reservation near the theater district so we had modest expectations given it's such a tourist trap area. The food here was quite good! The service was great. The only downer was it was SUPER loud. Definitely don't go here for a romantic evening or to have a nice chat with a friend you haven't seen in awhile. It was also fairly efficient, which wasn't surprising since they aren't looking for you to luxuriate over many courses over several hours. So we were in and out in an hour or so, 3 courses.\\n\\nThe caprese salad was good. The mozzarella was the star of that show-- really tasty and fresh. The squid ink pasta with seafood came with tons of pasta and seafood. I could not eat all of it despite my best efforts! Really tasty. Clearly houseware fresh pasta. My spouse loved the ravioli of the day and ate every drop. We topped it off with the pistachio tartuffo. OMG it was amazing! So beautiful and the ice cream was so light and tasty. Definitely recommend this place. We were pleasantly surprised with the delicious food and great service. We came here before seeing a broadway play and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and checked on us throughout the meal. We were able to easily finish our meal and make it to the theater.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are heading to a show as it is centrally located in the theater district, they can get you in and out in a short period of time (if needed) and the food was great. I will return and sample other items on the menu. Very classy, very traditional, waitstaff was excellent as was the food. Wine list was extensive and the wine recommended by the waiter was spot on.\\nMake a reservation before your favorite broadway show. We will be going back again! Wow! Right from the Caprese everything was amazing! The service was spot on and they had cloth napkins! The Chicken Fantasia's flavor was mind blowing and then the tartufo! I would come again just for the tartufo! Lucky find and it was just down the street from our hotel. Not good at all. We ordered three dishes and they are all the same things thrown together. The calamari is not good and the salad had only one leave of green, so they should not have put it under salad.... The risotto was also disappointing... not authentic Italian. Must have changed chefs and owner. This is a casual family style Italian restaurant in Times Square. I think this place is popular for pre-theater drinks/dinner. We got gin martinis to start which came in a large martini glass. We got a couple appetizers, the cheese and salami plate and Caesar salad. The Caesar dressing was nice and tangy. The cheese plate came with 2 cheeses and 3 salamis. I got the red snapper special which was red snapped on top of risotto. I didn't like that the red snapper was fried, I prefer grilled fish. The risotto was decent. I also liked the artichokes on top of the fish. For dessert, we shared the affogato and cheesecake. I didn't really care for either dessert. The cheesecake was dry and a little overdone. The affogato came with the coffee already on the ice cream instead of pouring the coffee on top so it was already melted when it got to the table. Overall, I've had much better Italian food in the area and there are nicer restaurants to go to. Awful. It took this fake Italian restaurant literally one entire hour to serve two of the worse pasta dishes I have ever tasted. Their spaghetti carbonara was so incredibly salty - I think they spent 10 minutes preparing the food and 50 minutes just salting it. Their kitchen is actually an intergalactic space ship that travels at the speed of light, causing a time dilation effect such the 2 minutes it takes them microwave their frozen TV pasta dinners equates to an hour of you waiting for it. Seriously, if you want some actually good Italian food check out Bar Pitti (highly recommend!) Shame on the restaurant for taking one hour to serve salt with a side of pasta. Shame on you if you fall into the same trap of going here. We ordered the farfalle primavera and fettuccine alfredo. Both were delicious and enough for three people to share! Would definitely come back here. Ambiance was great and zero wait time when we went in. Service was also great. Only bad thing was the initial bread, was not the best Flavorful food, beautiful ambiance, friendly wait staff. Everything was delicious. It was a very nice authentic meal. My go to spot in the Theater District!\\nBest to reserve ahead, especially for groups or if you need a less noisy spot. (There is no quiet spot.) I came specifically to this place because I saw many reviews that said they had very good carbonate, it arrived at the place and the service was very good, the food came out fast but, the carbonara is not what I expected, it had a lot of water and not flavor. Even if I let the server know about the incident, they didn't do anything about the food. I feel like I'm pay something that I didn't even finish.\\n\\nVery expensive for the quality of the food The food here is amazing, I had the Rigatoni with sausage and chicken and it was TO DIE FOR!!!!! Definitely would go back, the ambiance is great too!! Glad to stumble across this place and enjoy a seafood pasta. I had the squid ink, it was tasty and full of seafood that tasted so fresh. The pasta was a little too salty for me but overall so good that it wasn't worth complaining about. I sat at the bar so service was quick and great. Id return the next time I'm in New York City. Excellent homemade pasta dishes and easy to make reservations on RESY. I HIGHLY recommend the squid ink pasta. The pasta was outstanding, the sauce with flavorful and there was plenty of seafood! We also split the caprese appetizer which I recommend to add the table balsamic to because it's delicious. My husband and I were fortunate to be able to get a seat at 7pm on a Tuesday night in December. When we walked in, the host asked if we had a reservation. Unfortunately, Yelp didn't mention anything about needing a reservation.\\nThe prices were very reasonable given the location and menu. My husband got the 14oz NY Strip steak and I got Shrimp Alfredo. Both were absolutely delicious! The wait time for receiving our food was very short. My pasta tasted very fresh/homemade. Shortly after we received our food, a waiter came with fresh Parmesan and fresh ground black pepper. Very very pleased. Interesting menu. Great staff. Delicious food. Lovely atmosphere. I've been twice and will go again soon. Delicious! The service and staff are even better!\\nMarco helped us locate a lost gift certificate. He is patent and friendly even during busy pre- show dinner time. He is equally kind to his staff.\\nOur server, Arisevel, was quick, friendly and remembered details of our order. We so appreciate his attention to detail.\\nThe food was delicious and fresh. The restaurant was buzzing. Be sure to make a reservation! We will surely come back again and again! The food and service are fabulous here! I'm writing this review before we even leave our table as we were just blown away by our experience. For starters, the bread was warm and SO good. Our meals were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The food was so good that we also got some to go! Our server, Kevin, was extremely attentive and friendly. We marked this place as a favorite and will be back on our next trip to NYC! We had not been to this restaurant in several years. I am so happy to say that nothing has changed, this place is OUTSTANDING. The serves is first class from start to finish. The food is even better. We got the CARPACCIO DI MANZO for a starter. It was more than enough for the two of us and it was very good. I got the chicken parm with a side of spaghetti. The sauce and cheese were perfectly spread on top of the very thin, but huge piece of chicken. The flavor was terrific. My wife got the COTOLETTA ALLA MILANESE which was cooked and seasoned just right. This was one of the best meals we have had in a very long time. If you want great Italian food in NYC give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Love it . Good service. The place is clean and orginaize I wil back here again\\nFood good Their service was really good and wait times weren't that bad if you come in without a reservation. Their prices are reasonable and food was excellent We were looking for a good Italian near our hotel. Went based on reviews.\\nSat down at reservation time and server gave specials place looked busy but looking at served plates I was turned off.\\nI did not want to upset my wife se ordered a Caesar salad she ordered ravioli special. I asked if their wines were stored in a proper temp fridge he said yes. We ordered a nice bottle and glasses came dirty he then brought new glasses wine was served and food came Caesar was so soggy and wet and had no taste the ravioli was not edible it was similar to a lean cuisine....\\nService was mediocre.\\nStay away this is not the place to dine in a city with great options. Closed 3/28/22 by health department. No other info available. Do your research.\\n\\nGood reviews on the past. Ugh where do I even begin?! By far one of the best meals I had when visiting NY. I had the chicken parm which I'm still drooling over!! Everything tasted very authentic and delicious. Also tried their tiramisu which tasted like no other tiramisu I've ever had. Definitely recommend making reservations if you can. A solid Italian meal. Nothing we had was stand out but it was all good, and we enjoyed our time here. Service was a bit inconsistent, which was fine because we weren't in a rush, but maybe expect a bit longer of a dining experience. Fantastic food, fast service in a perfect pre theatre eating establishment. Loved the seafood over squid ink pasta. Probably one of my all time fave dishes. The pistachio tartuffo which I selected was insanely good and a very generous portion! It was our anniversary so of course I ate it all!\\nReservations recommended. Amazing and consistently delicious. love the chicken parmigiana and miste salad. Love Trecolori one of my favorites! I always ~fondly~ refer to my one and only time eating at Trattoria Trecolori as, singularly, one of the worst dining experiences that I've ever had. This review is two years overdue, but I knew I had to come here and leave a review because my horrible experience here still haunts me to this day (maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but you get the point).\\n\\nFirst thing, let me clarify that the ONLY reason we decided to eat here was because we were planning on going to a Broadway show right after (the restaurant was in close proximity to the theater). Never in my life would I ever willingly choose to eat here out of all the restaurants in the city - everything about this place screams \\\"TOURIST TRAP.\\\" It's essentially an overpriced and faux-authentic Italian restaurant for lazy tourists, and the only thing it has going for itself is its prime location. Anyway, my boyfriend and I had made a reservation here that day and actually arrived early. It was very busy, so we were fine with having to wait until our reservation time to be seated. However, despite getting there early AND having a reservation, they STILL somehow managed to seat us LATE. Aggravating, to say the very least.\\n\\nMoving onto the food... brace yourself for this one. The food quality was TERRIBLE at best. For one, I'm certain that the calamari was frozen and simply microwaved before being served to us - it was soggy, stale, and poorly seasoned. Bonus: it came with cheap-tasting, Chef Boyardee tomato sauce on the side! Moreover, the pasta was *definitely* store-bought - likely came from a box bought at Walmart or something, and it was also served with Kraft grated parmesan cheese (they can't even be arsed to use real cheese)... I 100% felt that I could make everything better at home myself, and probably for cheaper too.\\n\\nOverall, Trattoria Trecolori is horrendous and a sorry excuse for a restaurant. They're like a glorified Olive Garden and embellish themselves with a fancy-sounding Italian name, but the truth is, they couldn't be further from being an authentic Italian place. I wouldn't even recommend for anyone to go here out of convenience, literally go ANYWHERE but here. Very good service, very fresh food. Had a great experience with my family, the food was ready very quick, less than 15 minutes for a sit down restaurant in New York is amazing. Haven't had such great Italian in a very long time. My family wanted to eat Italian near our hotel that is walking distance. Passed by this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a try.\\nWe did family style and ordered lasagna,Squid Ink Pasta, Rigatoni Focaccia and a salad. They also serve complimentary bread to dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\\nThe food was good but I wouldn't say it's the best Italian spot in NYC. Great food and service. Nice atmosphere, too. Reservations are advised. I really enjoyed this place. Over the past twenty years when staying in Manhattan we'd always tried and stop at Trattoria Trecolori because of how great our first experience was back in early 2000. Since the location changed, I have noticed over time each visit the quality, service, and hospitality has gotten slowly worse. To the point after this most recent visit we won't return, I would rather eat the chain (Bond 45, Carmines, or Carbone) Italian which I know will be good. Sad to say as I always felt it was a hidden gem, but it's clear their priorities have changed.\\n\\nArrived for our reservation on time, we waited about 5 to 10 minutes once we sat down to get menus and get our drinks ordered. Our waiter was also filling water glasses, and it's possible they were understaffed - I get it, not a big deal. Overall table service was poor, empty glasses, etc. - never interacted with anyone other than waiter.\\n\\nWaiter took our order my son wanted to order the gnocchi with alfredo sauce but the waiter said it wasn't possible because it was already put together. Ok, disappointing but whatever. I then tried to order the spaghetti carbonara without onions, same response it was already premade. I was shocked - again if you want to run a high volume, low quality kitchen this makes sense. They charge $2.75 for a small soda glass, no refills. My son drank $15.00 in Sprite. Food was lukewarm and didn't have much flavor. Overall, really disappointing experience. Excellent take-out meal for this cold evening. I ordered through their website and my food was ready for pickup exactly when I needed it to be.\\n\\nLinguine Monsignore:\\nI am a fan of squid ink pasta. I don't always order it if it's on the menu because jt can be pricey. Aside from my pasta being a bit over cooked, the seafood was not. The quality of the seafood was excellent, I can tell they use fresh seafood and not that frozen crap. The seafood was also perfectly cooked. Although the roasted garlic marinara was nice and light, I almost wished it was an arrabiata sauce to give it a little kick. I really am a seafood lover, but for an overall, I'd probably try something else next time. Worth trying once.\\n\\nSpaghetti Carbonara:\\nI'm always skeptical of getting carbonara in fear that it would be too heavily creamy and dense. My fianc\\u00e9 ordered this dish, and I took a bite...then another and then another...This carbonara is delicious! It's probably the best carbonara I've ever had. Not heavy on the cream and not overly salty either. No regrets for sure.\\n\\nGarlic Bread:\\nAs described, 5 pieces of garlic bread that was perfectly garlicy to my taste with a crunchy outer yet soft inner. What a nice little restaurant inside and they also have outside seating. The service isn't the friendliest here, but the food is really good. My chicken Parm was just perfect! The decor inside is really nice but very open so it's a little noisy. The prices are pretty reasonable for New York City. Would not hesitate to go back here again. We chose this restaurant because it was open on Sunday and right across the street from the play we were seeing. Started with cocktails and shared the Tavola Trecolori. It consisted of Prosciutto, Burrata, olives and sopresata and was a great accompaniment to our drinks. Our entrees were the veal martini and a pasta primavera. Both were excellent and ample servings. For dessert, we shared the ricotta cheesecake with an after dinner drink. Service was excellent, prices were reasonable and the food delicious. Often, dining in the theatre district is hit or miss Trattoria Trecolori was definitely a hit. Excellent food and service! Reasonable prices for location - ideal for supper before or after a Broadway show! This little Italian gem is in the heart of the theater district. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was right on point. We order the chicken parmigiana and a ravioli special. Both were outstanding. The service was very knowledgeable and prompt and we were able to enjoy our dinner with plenty of time to be able to make our show. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in a meal before a show. Good solid food that's reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and seemed like the place had recently been remodeled. No standouts but good overall. I visited on a Sunday night. The linguine Neri was really good and the portion was larger than expected. Excellent Italian food! Had carbonara and penne arrabiatta. Best of four Italian restaurants we tried in the city. Will definitely return. Prior to our Broadway we had the opportunity to eat here. We called for a reservation- otherwise would not have been apple to eat there. Food was spectacular. This year had trip to Italy - this food was even better than some of our meals there. Staff was excellent & restaurant clean. Our 4th visit over the past few years. This time we sat outside and our wonderful waiter was Carlos.\\n\\nWe had the special, a cheese ravioli, on the recommendation of a friendly regular sitting at next table. Drank Old Fashioneds, served up, the way I like them, and they were excellent. We came here because the reviews were good and were very disappointed. Terrible food. Very salty. Reviews not accurate. Tourist trap. Find another place. Food was great! Service was the right balance between attentive and not pushy. Will definitely be back again Truly an experience.\\n\\nWalked in on a Friday night for dinner and absolutely adored this place. We outdid ourselves having ordered both the caprese salad and calamari to start after bread and butter for the table. The calamari came with squid, shrimp, zucchini and jalape\\u00f1os; super yummy and definitely shareable with a group of 3-4 people (it was a hefty serving).\\n\\nI had the spaghetti carbonara for my entree and when I say it was a party in my mouth, I mean it. Excellent balance of flavors and it was not overly salty or greasy from the pancetta. The rigatoni was also great with chicken and sausage.\\n\\nIt was an experience because of how attentive the servers were- frequent water refills and plate refreshes. Everybody loves fresh cracked black pepper too HAha. Strong drinks here is another plus! Will be going on my recommendation list for everyone to try out Not sure why this place was so highly rated. All the dishes were super salty. Waiters wipe down tables, handles dirty dishes and silverware, and THEN cuts bread for other guest barehanded.\\n\\nWaiter was nice. Grea Italian restaurant at a good cost for families trying to visit the city on a budget. Great ambiance and good food. I recommend the lasagna, one of the best I've had in a while. Service was very quick and efficient. The restaurant has 109 violation points. One of which is evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.\\nDiner beware.\\n\\nhttps://patch.com/new-york/foresthills/nyc-restaurants-ordered-closed-march-25-april-1 Yesterday I had lunch at this restaurant and really enjoyed it. We started with their Potato Leek Soup with grilled asparagus, which was wonderful. I then opted to have their fresh past special which was stuffed ravioli which did not disappoint. They were not very busy, and I found their level of service to be outstanding. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food and nice ambiance. Our go-to before a Broadway show. Wonderful menu. Definitely a busy restaurant so make sure you have a reservation. Solid food. My wife and I ate here yesterday, prior to attending the Andrea Bocelli show at MSG. The cocktail I ordered was good, as was the salad and our cappucinos and tartufo dessert. Unfortunately, everything else was mediocre at best. The clams oreganato consisted of several quite small clams (one of the shells only had breadcrumbs). As far as entr\\u00e9es, My Rigatoni with chicken and sausage was not good (hard chunks of chicken with bland sausage - hot but otherwise bland). What was not hot was my wife's ravioli (came out just slightly warm), which was supposed to be stuffed with cheese and broccoli rabe. The entr\\u00e9e consisted of flat raviolis just barely stuffed - not nearly enough to actually be able to taste the filling.\\n\\nThis morning, I checked the Health Score on Yelp's Page (I will always check this from now on when looking up restaurants). If you click on the Health Score (Grade Pending), it will bring you to this write up:\\n\\n- Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.\\n- Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.\\n\\nNeedless to say - we will not be back. There are too many other great dinning options in Manhattan. Service at the bar was excellent. Drink glasses were always full, service was quick and attentive. Food was very average. Chicken park wasn't anything special. Sat at the bar for a great meal on the fly. Had the carbonara which was delightful. Service from the bartender was really good considering how busy he was. Place has a nice feel and is clean and nice. Good times! Everything about this restaurant was top notch! White tablecloth, nice low lighting but not too low. The food was AMAZING. We started with Mista salads and I had the butternut squash stuffed ravioli and my husband had the lasagna. Dessert for me was a generous serving of mango sorbet and my husband opted for the ricotta-cr\\u00e8me cheesecake. Not being used to the ricotta, we're a tad disappointed that it wasn't as creamy. But that still doesn't knock off a star! Quick yet non obtrusive service couldn't have e been better. Walked to the Broadway show afterwards. Would definitely eat her again! Nobody Italian works here. The carbonara is the worst I ever had. It was soup with noodles. They brought it before my appetizer of carpaccio, which while the meat was very good, they showered it with lettuce not arugula. And after everything else came out, they finally brought me the bread, which was so chewy it felt like it was heated in a microwave not in an oven. I politely paid for my meal, but didn't consume more than three bites of anything. Great service!! Food was excellent with reasonnable portions. Not too expensive for the location. Omg, the food and service is the top. First time visiting NY and we decided to visit an Italian place. If you are looking for full flavor palate in your mouth come here. The wine, lasagna and carbonara was just delicious!\\nThe service deserves separate 5 starts Mindblowing food, convient location, great ambience and fantastic service ..high recommended place. Great food and service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend the restaurant . I will definitely come back Sooo happy we stopped at this restaurant. This cute restaurant is tucked away in the busy area near Time Square. The service was fast and the employees were very polite and kind. The food was \\\"UHMAZing\\\". One thing is the bill will add up quickly lol, but it's worth it. Stop reading every review and focus on me. Stop what you are doing and please for the sake of your tastebuds go to this restaurant.\\nWe were in town for a Broadway show and our plans fell thru to go nearby for a family style restaurant. So I came to yelp and found this gem. THANK YOU FELLOW YELPERS. The place was packed but we waited around for a while and were able to snag some bar seats. Bartender was very attentive right away, and we got our waters and glass of wine within 2 minutes. I highly recommend the \\\"decoy\\\" Cabernet Sauvignon. We got a starter garden salad. Its a salad, can't get too fancy with this, it hit the spot. WAIT I have to backup 5 minutes. When the wine came out complimentary bread basket with oil, balsamic, and butter came. The bread was still warm, and when we finished the first basket, the second came quickly.\\nFor our main course we got a shrimp Alfredo dish, and the ny strip with broccoli rabe. Phenomenal! Garlic euphoria, highly recommended. While sitting at the bar we were conveniently located near the dessert prep station... so how could we say no?! We went with the tiramisu, but honestly if we had any room left would've went with the pistachio ice cream as well, or even the scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over top. We will definitely be returning to nyc simply for this restaurant! My partner and I visited this restaurant last night for dinner. We did a walk in because it was a weeknight and didn't think it would be busy.\\n\\nWe came in around 6:15 and it was a little busy. The lady manning the front of the house told us that there were no tables available and the only seats available were by the bar, and that if we chose to wait, we wouldn't be seated in the next 15 mins or so because people with reservations would be coming in shortly. We reluctantly decided to take the bar seats.\\n\\nTen minutes later, a lot of people left and it wasn't that busy anymore. A family of four came in and did a walk in, and were immediately given a table. Throughout our whole stay, multiple tables were empty and we were the only ones sitting at the bar.\\n\\nWe felt we were racially discriminated. The food we ordered was actually topnotch and the bartender/server gave us excellent service. This made the whole experience even more unsatisfactory because had we not been treated as such by said lady, this would've been a 5-star rating review. Went by yelp reviews, the location was perfect for seeing Six on broadway and the fact we could make a reservation in advance was KEY!!! I was actually surprised how delicious it was! We got the ravioli special and tiramisu. Service was good and fast but they did try to rush is through. really good food and great service! chicken parm was amazing, and great selection on the menu. will definitely come back. August 13th 2023 around 7pm myself and 3 other family members decided to have dinner at this restaurant after seeing a play. When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the greeter who told us the empty tables were reserved and that we could be seated at the bar. Initially we decided to dine at another restaurant however we decided to sit at the bar which is full service only because we did want to have Italian food for dinner. It became extremely obvious within the first 30 minutes that this location did not want to seat us at a table and these tables that were available were not reserved. We realized that we were being discriminated against clearly there were no customers dining that looked like us. Once the greeter realized that we were there to actually have dinner and spend money that was the color GREEN she offered a table and we declined. I will make this review as brief as I can but I will say I was extremely surprised that I as a native New Yorker would walk into ANY restaurant and be discriminated due to the color of my skin...WOW NOT IN MY CITY WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED...UNACCEPTABLE! The head bartender PIAL who has worked at this restaurant for MANY years gave us the experience we deserved he was the bartender the waiter he was EVERYTHING HE WAS GREAT! He told us that he would serve us with whatever he could and he made sure we celebrated a birthday by having the staff come to the bar and sing happy birthday his service was SUPERB to say the least...The food was awesome he made sangria which was awesome and he was the reason WHY we decided to stay at the bar. It is UNACCEPTABLE to judge a book by its cover...PIAL took care of US and we took care of HIM HAPPILY! We thank him in this review and SHAME ON MANAGEMENT -OWNERS of this restaurant for discriminating against those that they deem not suitable to dine at their restaurant...hence the reason for the ONE STAR. Trattoria Trecolori touts itself as the \\\"Best Italian Restaurant in the Theater District\\\" and its food make a very convincing argument. With daily specials of the day, wonderful customer service, a gorgeous interior, and an array of pasta dishes to choose from, you can't go wrong with a post-Broadway show dinner here.\\n\\nFARFALLE ALLA CARBONARA $18 (bow-tie pasta, pancetta, fresh herbs and onion in brodo with a touch of cream)\\nMy boyfriend ordered this and I was refraining myself from switching dishes with him. Bow-tie pasta and carbonara are my ultimate weakness and this dish tasted fantastic.\\n\\nRIGATONI FOCACCIA $19 (diced chicken, rosemary and sun-dried tomato in a tasty tomato-cream)\\nI've taken a liking to sun-dried tomato since a couple of years ago and this dish only validated my palate even more. The pasta could've been cooked a little longer but the sauce was just right, especially with the generous amount of cheese the server flung atop.\\n\\nTiramisu $9\\nWe were a little disappointed because it wasn't the greatest we had but we still finished it! Also I think it's big enough to share with 2-3 people. Salmon was excellent, and service was attentive. Atmosphere was very, but welcoming. For being in the Theatre District of Manhattan, Trattoria Trecolori gives off the feeling of a cosy neighborhood Italian joint, instead of overpriced tourist trap which is the vibe that many of the restaurants near Times Square emanate.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other detailed reviews with pics, so here the notes from my meal:\\n\\n* Party of three were promptly seated around 3pm, so as to avoid the evening dinner rush.\\n\\nPRO TIP - since we were headed to the airport after this meal, we had our luggage with us, which the hostess graciously offered to store in their office. This was very helpful since we didn't block the aisles with our bags and didn't have to run back to the hotel after eating.\\n\\n* Tasteful decor without being tacky; exposed brick with Italian motif artwork. Nice lighting and high ceilings.\\n\\n* Food - eclectic mix of well prepared food without the usual \\\"spaghetti and meatballs\\\" fare one finds at Olive Garden. We opted to split an order of the house special lasagna as well as the recommended Chicken parm. The lasagna sauce had a rich tomato base with the just amount of oregano, pepper, salt, dried basil, and rosemary - all baked in with tasty blend of meat. Chicken parm was nicely fried to a crispy golden brown, and freshly melted mozzarella was topped with the house marina. Side of spaghetti was okay, but a little too al dente for my taste. Basket of house bread was good for sopping up all of the sauce on the plate.\\n\\n* Service was as I like it - attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a very SOLID option if you want to grab a bite before a show, or even a \\\"special event\\\" place when in Manhattan. Stopped here for lunch and it was exactly what we were looking for! They had a clean outdoor dining space and the inside was beautiful. The homemade pasta and imported meats and cheese were delicious, and we found all of our dishes to be so flavorful. Our server was excellent and our food came out quickly. I will be recommending this spot and will be sure to come back on my future NYC visits! Good Italian food, decent ambiance and right next to times Square. Everything was perfect untill they came with a bill that had a 18% included gratuity. Wonder if it's because we did not look local or something else. I understand that you do this if it's a large group or serving food during closing time. I don't think they did this for every table but we were selectively picked. In all honesty their service was good and I would have gladly left them 20% or more. The food came out quickly . The star of the show was the gnocchi. The ravioli was creamy and soft. The minestrone soup was a little bland. I wish they treated customers equally and get rid of such shady practices. Excellent! Ambiance is perfect. Found this place just walking around. Chef came out himself to talk to us and made us a specialty of his not on menu. Prices were reasonable for NYC. Would recommend! Yep good food good service. It's loud in the dining area. Pappadella was tasty. Ravioli a 10. Minestrone soup was bland. Calamari was great. Nice joint do it if your here and need to get in somewhere. The food was really good. I would highly recommend it as the pasta was great and the service is very quick Came here on a busy Friday night. Cute little Italian place just off Broadway. Very busy at 4:45 PM. Might be the pre-three theater crowd. If you want something that's not on the menu just ask. I had seen eggplant Parmesan online, but it was not on the menu. They brought me an excellent dish of eggplant Parmesan. I highly recommend this place. Great food!!! Veal, pasta- all great! Wine selection and prices are brilliant. Service was professional. Thank you Pial for an awesome experience! Celebrated my daughter's birthday with dessert here! Dessert was wonderful and staff was super nice. San HB to her and made her feel so special. Will be coming back for more food!!! It was very good. service was prompt and efficient. Definitely recommend a small group or even a date night. My friend and I were there for a dinner, and the food was honestly delicious and very rich in flavors, we where very pleasant surprised about that. Also one of the servers was very polite and helpful about deciding which meal to take and which wine to compare to the dish. The only thing we personally didn't like was because we went to Italian restaurant and there wasn't any Italian working, any Italian music on radio and the payment was only in cash, but other than that this place is definitely the place you want to visit if you' re nearby and looking for a great food. :) Awesome Italian spot that I think I'll come back again! Came here with a party of seven for a reservation at 8pm. Restaurant was pretty lively, but we were immediately seated. Our table ordered a whole bunch of food and prosecco and red wine, and of the things I tried I had the Squid ink linguine with seafood ($27) , ricotta cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake ($9 each). Total bill split seven ways was $47 per person including tax and tip, but mind you this includes the prosecco and red wines we got for the Night too.\\n\\nAMBIANCE:\\nTraditional Italian restaurant vibe. Restaurant wasn't too loud so good for groups and for a good conversation. In heart of times square I'd say that's a rarity.\\n\\nPROS:\\nAbsolutely loved the squid ink pasta! The noodles were really fresh and you can taste the extra umami flavors the squid ink imparts on the linguine. The marinara sauce had a little heat to it, which I think pairs well with the mountain of seafood that came with the pasta. There were shrimp, scallops, calamari, and little neck clams. Seafood was fresh and tasty, and the garlic in the sauce really adds so much depth of flavors to the dish.\\n\\nDessert wise, chocolate mousse cake was spectacular. Layered between each sponge cake was a thick creamy velvety dark chocolate mousse, wasn't too sweet, and the cake literally melts in your Mouth. Absolutely would come back just for the cake, and for what you're paying I'd say it's a good size as well!\\n\\nMy friends seemed to enjoy their entrees. Some other shout out dishes include the Alfredo pasta and the chicken parmesan.\\n\\nCONS:\\nRicotta cheesecake wasn't my favorite. The cheese was a little chalky imo, and the texture wasn't as smooth. Maybe it's a ricotta thing.\\n\\nBread also came out a little cold and stale. Wasn't my favorite.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nDecent Italian spot, their pastas are their signatures and their chocolate mousse is a home run! Excellent Italian food. We were able to get an early reservation after a matinee.\\n\\nFriendly and attentive wait staff. Seafood and pasta were tender, fresh and delicious. We ordered the gnocchi with eggplant, the monkfish special and the squid ink pasta with seafood. All were delivered piping hot and fresh.\\n\\nFor dessert we enjoyed affogato and tiramisu. These were also delicious. Delicious food great service reasonable prices. Great atmosphere. Our go to place before theatre Cute after Theatre Italian spot! Place was buzzing on a Monday eve. My daughter loved the Shrimp Alfredo and Caesar Salad. Would come back for a bite next time we are in NYC! Not only excellent food but a very good value with excellent service. We went twice while visiting. I spent a good time at this place. They provide a good service. Dinner was great. But ricotta cheesecake made my day! Highly recommend! Thanks! Since many other Italian places were closed between lunch and dinner times, and we were trying to eat around 3 PM, we decided to give this place a try. I thought it might have been a tourist trap since this is near Times Square, but I was pleasantly surprised! Even my boyfriend, who is a native New Yorker, really enjoyed this place.\\n\\nWe ordered the Linguine Nere Alla Monsignore ($27), which is homemade black squid ink linguini with shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, and mussels in marinara.\\n-It was a large portion and there was plenty of seafood and sauce. It had great flavor and it's a must-try for any seafood and pasta lovers. All of the seafood was perfectly tender, and nothing too chewy. The squid ink pasta was wonderful too. I thought everything worked really well together.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Gamberoni Dello Chef ($26), Jumbo Shrimp in savory wine sauce and risotto.\\n-This was a huge portion as well and the shrimp were huge. I really liked the flavor of the risotto, and it was not a super creamy risotto. Everything was delicious. It was a touch on the salty side, but not insanely salty.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend both dishes, but maybe the Squid Ink Pasta more since there was more variety in the dish and seemed like more of a signature dish. Both were super flavorful though.\\n\\nOnly thing that was meh to me was the bread. It was kind of hard and didn't seem super fresh or high quality. Just like plain white bread you can get from the market. That was a bit disappointing since many Italian restaurants have freshly baked bread.\\n\\nThe server we got wasn't the best either. He wasn't very friendly and acted kind of uptight. We also asked for pasta/risotto recommendations and instead of giving us a couple choices, he only picked out the 2 most expensive pasta/risotto dishes. Which is fine, they were great, but it seemed kind of weird to us that he was insistent we get those dishes. And when we got the check, there was an 18% tip already included. It definitely made sense he pushed the priciest dishes on us.\\n\\nSo keep in mind that there's an included 18% tip already. Restrooms were decent and were downstairs in the basement. Go down the stairs on the left side when you enter the restaurant. Service and bread were the reasons why I couldn't give it 5 stars, but the food is definitely really good here! Highly recommended --\\nespecially if you love authentic Italian food!\\nThis was our second visit and the first since the beginning of the pandemic. The ambience is cozy but unpretentious and the wait staff is well-trained and attentive. Our dinner (along with drinks and appetizers) was tasty and lovingly prepared. We felt totally comfortable eating indoors I work without a reservation, they didn't serve me because there's only two people in my party right before me. Five people without the reservation no problem but customer service I will not recommend this restaurant. Back again for a group dinner. What a treat to be back! Missed this place\\n\\nWe had a selection tonite. Each one better than the previous. Trecolori salads. Fantastically fresh. Then shared 3 pastas. Special then seafood then gluten free. Entrees were chicken osso buco and fish and chop. Awesome. Cooked perfectly. Washed down with reasonably priced wine. What a treat!!! Exceeded my expectations... good food and very friendly and helpful staff. Would Recomend. Visiting NYC, dying for Italian. Food and service were friendly and sleek, what a well-oiled machine. And the food- awesome! Great theater district Italian spot. Menu covers all the classics with some interesting specials. Crisp service, food comes fast and hot. Loved it, will be back for simple, classic Italian. The rigatoni I pasta was good - 5/5. Very flavorful and good portions. A bit overpriced but good nonetheless.\\n\\nStrawberry G&T was also good - 5/5. Good pour.\\n\\nThe desserts were what really brought down the review. We ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate mousse cake and both were terrible. The tiramisu was too dry and the chocolate cake was overly sweet with not enough of that \\\"mousse\\\" creamy taste. 1.5/5 for the desserts. Would not recommend. #1 Italian place in nyc. Been there three times already, and it is absolutely amazing. Affordable, delicious, and fancy. Although everything we ordered was extremely delicious, I especially enjoyed calamari, vongole and carbonara. Their chocolate cake was also tasty. Everyone who works here were very kind. The guy at the bar, the lady who greeted us, and our server... everyone was extremely nice.\\n\\nThis place deserves 10 starts. I would definitely recommend this place. The food is very good. I wished that the menu had more veal dishes. Service is friendly, polite, and gracious. Why would I give Trattoria Trecolori two stars, when my guests and I thought most everything was delightful? It was because of my strip steak. I asked for it to be cooked very rare. It was not, and the waiter took it back to the kitchen. I don't know why, it wasn't as if they could cook it any less.\\nHe returned with the cook's answer that it was the rarest they could cook the meat. First of all, that's not true. I've cooked meat, and I've been to better restaurants than Trecolori, and know it's possible to have it rarer. If it were a question of it needing to be a certain temperature which precluded it being served very rare, I should have been told when I ordered it. But somehow, I don't think that's the case, since they serve thinly sliced raw beef.\\n\\nSo I tried a bite. I should have quit sooner. It was hard to cut, because of tendons or ligaments. My friend offered me her steak knife, but that didn't do it either. I carved around the stuff I couldn't cut through, and put a piece into my mouth. And I chewed it. And chewed it somemore. And finaly swallowed it, thinking it just was not going to get any more tender.\\n\\nThe meat was substandard and should never have been served. And it should have been taken off the check when I complained about it the degree of doneness and they didn't offer me other one.\\n\\nSo, I asked them to wrap it up, because I wanted to take it home. For my dog, I added in a slightly raised voice.\\n\\nAnd as soon as the money is deducted from my debit card, I'm going to put in a claim with the bank for $32, the price of the steak.\\n\\nOtherwise, the drinks were great, we enjoyed the Tavola Tricolori, the lamb chops, the veal chop, and the pastaccio tartuffo.\\n\\nAnd Eli, my dog, found nothing wrong with the steak. I took a friend out for dinner last night to celebrate his birthday. He loves Italian food, so I'm always on the hunt for the perfect one. We came upon Trattoria after a Yelp search when my original choice failed to meet my high standards.\\n\\nFirst off, it's a very pretty space. And, the hostess really sealed the deal with her engaging and effervescent personality. There's nothing like that welcoming feeling from a restaurant you are just walking into for the first time. More NYC restaurants could take a lesson here. She's a rarity.\\n\\nWe sat at a lovely table in the back. Now, neither of us drink. Too often that gets a shunning response from waiters in restaurants that are frequented by wine drinkers. But, not here. That always scores well with me too.\\n\\nWe started with the fried calamari for him and a Caesar salad for me. Sorry, my nephew's getting married Saturday so I'm not eating carbs.\\n\\nNormally this dish is served as a fried medley of calamari and shrimp garnished with fried zucchini and peppers served with marinara. But he only wanted the calamari and they easily adjusted without a problem.\\n\\nMy friend was very satisfied. And he's sometimes a picky eater.\\n\\nMy salad was a classic \\\"Caesare\\\" with shaved parmesano and garlic-rosemary croutons. Delish!\\n\\nOne of my friend's requests was that the restaurant I chose have really good Italian bread. We all have our thing. Mine is oysters. This is where they fell short. The two pieces I tried to nibble were rock hard. Not even edible. And he was disappointed that it had sesame seeds and looked and tasted like cheap store bought bread. Artisan this was not. Given the caliber of their food and service, this should have been better.\\n\\nFor our main entree I had the beef carpaccio. Thinly sliced raw filet mignon, arugula, roasted peppers, capers and shaved parmesano. Again, a winner. Delish.\\n\\nEmil has the Spaghetti ala Carbonara: Pancetta, fresh herbs, and onions \\\"en brodo\\\" with a touch of cream. And he added chicken to the dish. He liked it, but thought it was a bit over salted.\\n\\nI requested a piece of their homemade ricotta cheesecake and a candle to end the dinner with a happy birthday. What I wasn't expecting and was pleasantly surprised by was the gaggle of waiters who gathered around us to sing him happy birthday as the rest of the dining room joined in.\\n\\nThat last bit was the cherry on the cake of the day.\\n\\nAs for the service is was top notch. From the back waiters to the main servers, the service was friendly, attentive and professional. It kind of flawless.\\n\\nThe only thing I'd suggest is updating their site with a current menu. I originally looked at this place and almost didn't choose it because of the outdated one. The food was excellent, but the pistachio tartufo will live on in my mind forever. I loved it. This was my first Italian restaurant I went to when I visited NYC last week. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a very intimate setting/environment. I don't recall my server's name but he was so amazing! Very knowledgeable about the menu! We ordered calamari, minestrone soup, chicken parmigiana, ravioli, linguine al vongole and tiramisu. We had a picky eater with us and they LOVED the food here. I ordered the linguine al vongole and it was so tasty! I also loved the tiramisu. The calamari was lighted breaded and fried which made it delicious! The portions were a good size! We came back a second time right before we left. Definitely recommend! Was a pleasant visit however no heaters outside in a raw 50 degree rainy evening.\\n\\nService was prompt and courteous.\\nOrdered the spaghetti carbonaro and pollo scarpariello (chicken and sausage with french fries). Along with two delicious red wines and sambuca and a limoncello.\\n\\nOnly thing that could have made it better was the heaters working. Loved this little cozy restaurant. Sat at a table for 2 in the back. Waiter was an older Italian gentleman with a thick accent. My husband had a glass of the Chianti reserva and I had the super Tuscan. My husband ordered the minestrone soup and chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. His soup came out steaming hot and was fresh and tasty. I ordered the veal martini. The veal was encrusted with Parmesan cheese and had a vermouth sauce with artichoke hearts. I asked to substitute spaghetti for the veggies. The spaghetti on both our plates was a little too al dente. Still tasty with excellent service.\\nWe finished with a mixed berry sorbetto. This place was lively and cozy. Loved the atmosphere. I would return to try other dishes next time I'm in New York. Very enjoyable experience. Our meal was delicious and the place is beautiful. Great location for those going to the theater. Fantastic service. Food was great as well. Favorites were: Cesar salad and chocolate cake dessert Great food and great service. Very friendly staff. Super Italian food. Reasonable prices. Accommodated our party of 12 (including4 small kids)and really took care of us. Great location - walking distance from Grand central, Times Square, and off-Broadway shows. A broad menu including Italian-American favorites and some gourmet surprises. Extremely well executed! They really know how to cook - a connoisseur's version of an Italian family restaurant. Trattoria Trecolori is probably a touristy restaurant but then anything near Times Square is probably a tourist trap. With that being said though, Trattoria Trecolori was pretty decent. We had a broadway show nearby so this was a great place to eat before the show. Make reservations ahead of time to save yourself some time and trouble.\\n\\nSo it's Italian food, so expect Italian stuff. Pasta, risotto, veal, and the like. It's hefty and pretty filling so you won't need to worry about leaving hungry. I'm a sucker for seafood anything so I got the risotto mare e terra which had a generous portion of seafood and calamari. Everything about the risotto was pretty heavy so I couldn't even finish it as good as it was.\\n\\nSo aside from good food and nice ambiance, the location is convenient for all your Times Square needs. It's a little pricier here though when is Italian not pricey? The first thing I noticed when entering this Italian place was how friendly the staff was and how they made customers feel at home especially our waiter (didnt get his name but he was the only waiter who looked older than other waiters).\\n\\nI loved how as soon as we sat down he asked \\\"...or would you prefer some good 'ol NY tap water?\\\"\\nThe restaurant was quite busy and it only became more packed as time passed. Luckily we didn't require reservations but highly it's highly recommended. Atmosphere was somewhat lively but not my kind of ambience - at least I didn't have to yell throughout the night for the other person to hear me. Price was reasonable although it wouldn't hurt to bring down the cost of the drinks.\\n\\nNow for the meals and dessert:\\n- Calamari: needed to be fried a bit more but it was still delicious especially the sauce. It also had fried zucchini which was interesting\\n- Linguine alla vongole: clams were fresh and sauce was just right\\n- Tortellini alla panna: substituted the ham with mushroom. Did not enjoy this bc it was creamy and I failed to realize this when I placed the order. Although I didn't like it, others may feel differently.\\n- Tiramisu: now THIS was delicious. I could've had three more. Probably one of the best tiramisu I've had. Service was excellent! Ambiance delightful! Bread was fresh and hot, served with butter. However, I was very disappointed in my entree. The risotto was way too al dente, to the point I couldn't finish it. I had such high hopes because of other reviews and initially it seemed it was going to be a great meal, but fell flat with the main course! Very good food for decent prices. Certainly no worse price-wise than an Olive Garden. And this place spanks Olive Garden (after giving it a safe word, of course).\\n\\nAnd the gin and tonics use Fever Tree tonic water. Ooh, I felt classy! Great little Italian place in Times Square area. Popped in for an early dinner before a show and was delighted with the service and food. My friends and I came to Trattoria Trecolori at 7pm on a Tuesday. I made a reservation via Yelp and would recommend doing so if you're going around a peak time. When we left around 8:30pm, the restaurant had really slowed down. The ambiance here is classy and has more of an upscale vibe. However, it can get loud but it was never to the point where I couldn't hear my friends so I didn't mind.\\n\\nTwo of us ordered the gnocchi alla baba ($19) and my other friend ordered the rigatoni alla trecolori ($19). For a small portion of pasta that isn't anything super crazy, I do think it's a bit overpriced. However, it matches up with the location and ambiance. The food is also delicious, so I wouldn't mind treating myself here once in a while. The gnocchi is silky and chewy, and makes a great combination with the sauce, cheese, and eggplant.\\n\\nService here is outstanding. The staff here is so respectful and really makes you feel at home. There are constant check-ins and you never have to ask for your water to be refilled. The combination of exceptional service, nice ambiance, and tasty food makes Trattoria Trecolori a favorite! I shouldn't be surprised that my experience here was SO good. Our last night in New York and mom wanted Italian food, we had reservations at one of the well known/popular spots but due to our experiences, opted for something a little closer to our hotel. Trattoria popped up and the # of reviews and stars swayed me.\\n\\nPopped in and they were busy, thankfully I had a reservation. From the moment we sat down, our experience was stellar. Our server, an older gentleman was super funny, personable and just overall pleasant. He joked around with us and really gave off this positive vibe. When my mom ordered the Brooklynn lager, he literally did a small sideways fist pump ha! Food was stellar, one of the best basic pastas I've had in a long time. I got the penne arrabiatta (tomato, basil, roasted garlic and spicy red pepper); flavors were spot on, chunks of fresh tomato, a nice mellow kick, chunks of garlic. The parmesan and black pepper really elevated it. Mom got the linguine alla vongole (clams and cockles saut\\u00e9ed in white wine, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil); definitely a lighter, but still flavorful and fresh dish. Also good. Service was amazingly efficient and attentive. Space is simply decorated allowing for exposed brick walls and beautiful flooring to stand out.\\nFood was exquisite from the appetizer of TAVOLA TRECOLORI to the gnocchi all\\u00e1 babba and the luscious cheese cake.\\nHighly recommend! \",\n          \"Very Parisian for not being in Paris, such a quintessential little atmosphere. In regard to the food, brunch is the way to go, however the evening ambiance is exceptional. Either way, it's always delicious, and from my experience, they really have consistency down. For dinner, the coq au vin is great. For brunch, the french toast is very impressive, one of the best I've had (but I'm not extremely well versed in the french toast category).\\n\\nThe chocolate mousse is one of my top 5 deserts, worldwide. This is the wowest of wows of anything you could order here. Neat little cafe tucked away in Greenwich Village, just around the corner from the \\\"Friends\\\" apartment. We were not hungry, but I had always wanted to try a Tarte Tatin! So, we loaded up on desserts and enjoyed every bite.\\nService was ok. They were busy and I think the server was irritated with us because we had no idea what we were doing!\\nWe ordered a chocolate croissant to-go...which ended up being the gosh dang best croissant I've ever had!\\nI truly wish I could have spent more time here. Buvette has a lot of potential but I personally thought the portions were not substantial whatsoever. The food was good, but for the cost, I would've expected to be at least a bit closer to full after ordering 4+ dishes for 3 people. After eating, I was craving another meal somewhere nearby.\\n\\nHowever, I know there's a lot of hype surrounding Buvette so I had to give it a try. It is pretty busy, so if you can get a reservation, I would recommend doing so! Their foods were delicious with lots of French appetizers, and small dishes. I would recommend getting the Moules au Curry, as the curry sauce, mussels, and fries complemented each other well.\\n\\nAgain, the main reason I am docking off points is because after drinks and food, the bill wasn't cheap (as expected in NYC), and I left still hungry for more. 5 Stars for a beloved breakfast spot that's worth the wait. (Plus, those eggs are everything)\\n\\nWe got to Buvette and were prepared for a line, and we were not disappointed (lol). We waited about 25 minutes for an indoor spot (given the chilly weather) and then took our seats by the bar. It is a tight fit, but all great spots in NYC are tight, so get cozy, friends!\\n\\nJessy was our lovely server and was friendly, attentive, and not bothered by the crazy rush and long line outside. She got us started with some espresso drinks and food.\\n\\n- Cappuccino: FABULOUS- especially paired with the...\\n- Almond croissant: Yup. This one is a winner. I like my coffee with no sugar, so pairing it with a sweet bite is always a good choice. This croissant is flaky and covered in almond slivers and powdered sugar. YUM\\n- Jambon cru & Chevre: Both of these are steamed egg dishes on crusty toast. The jambon includes thinly sliced prosciutto with shaved parm and the chevre includes goat cheese and sundried cherry tomatoes. We devoured both of them, but the star of these dishes is the steamed eggs, which are cooked with the steamer of a coffee machine! It's a creamy revelation!\\n\\nOverall, a great experience we would absolutely repeat. Honestly this place is damn good but the portion sizes are itty bitty. Came here Saturday brunch and didn't have a reservation so I decided to come pretty early (9:30) and was able to get seated right away. This was a good call because come 15-20 minutes later and the lines were out the door.\\n\\n- CRQ Madame - I feel like usually Croque Madame are too dry for me but I actually really liked this dish as the mayonnaise(??) complimented the cheese, bread, and ham very well. I also loved the egg on top - especially since the yolk drenched the entire sandwich.\\n- Pain Perdu - I usually am pretty skeptical of eating sweet things for breakfast but DAMN this was good. I really appreciated that even without dipping the bread into the eggy sauce, that the bread was already full coated with flavor and the sauce was just an extra oomph. Also I didn't find it too sweet which was nice. Honestly I could just eat the cream sauce and be happy.\\n\\nOverall, I loved eating here especially because the place is so so cute! However, I will say that I have to give it -1 star because the portion sizes are simply too small. They really are the size of a tapas and definitely need to order more than one to get full. Like stepping into a busy cafe in Paris! Charming restaurant with attentive and friendly service (ok- so maybe NOT like being in Paris). The food was also delicious! We were so eager to eat our egg dishes that I forgot to take pictures. Everything was delicious! Arrived on Sunday around 2:30PM and there was a line outside. We were a group of four and got seated based on party so fortunately the wait was around 10ish minutes to be seated in the heated outdoor table.\\n\\nService is good and only ordered the recommended items. Enjoyed all three so would plus one on these food items: pain perdu, crq madame, and jambon cru This restaurant specializes in fine French cuisine and fine wines. The menu generally includes traditional French snacks, appetizers, French sandwiches, cheese platters, desserts, etc. From appetizers to main courses to desserts, every dish is carefully crafted with rich flavors and textures. The restaurant also offers a variety of fine wines and cocktails to complement the food.\\n\\nThe restaurant's decoration is elegant and unique, using warm colors to create a warm and romantic atmosphere. The interior decoration is simple and exquisite, allowing guests to feel the romance and elegance of French life.\\n\\nWhether sharing a delicious meal with friends or a romantic dinner with your loved one, Buvette is a great choice. If you like French food and exquisite restaurant atmosphere, you might consider trying Buvette to experience the pure French food culture. I enjoyed Buvette, but I actually thought the food was a little overhyped for how famous a brunch place this is.\\n\\nBuvette follows a common model of many restaurants, not taking reservations or a virtual waitlist. Instead, to get a seat you need to line up outside the storefront. On weekends and during brunch hours (11-2) the line can get pretty long but the food comes out fast and the servers try to keep the line moving as quickly as possible.\\n\\nHaving never been, my friend and I decided to each get a steamed soft scramble as it's their specialty. He got a Jambon Cru, and I got a Ch\\u00e8vre. I found the eggs to be well-cooked, but pretty salty and not evenly seasoned. The food was also a little pricey for what we ended up receiving.\\n\\nI definitely recommend still trying this place out and gaming the line - it's very possible I went on an off day, and I would definitely consider going back to try a few more of their dishes. I've been meaning to try Buvette for ages and finally found some time to stop by for a weekday dinner. My friend and I had a reservation, but even though there aren't many slots online, when we arrived, there were still plenty of tables available for walk-ins. (I assume the queue on weekends is a different story).\\n\\nThe other reviews have covered this enough, even so, I was still a bit surprised at how really quite small the restaurant is :0 Nice traditional decor overall (although I'm not sure how much of that is simply old versus intentionally antique haha).\\n\\nWe ordered the dauphinois (potato gratin), a croque monsieur, and and their daily special, the \\\"gratin ancienne\\\" ... which was a bit confusing at first, because I'm almost certain that this usually refers to gratin dauphinois \\u00e0 l'ancienne, i.e. the potato dish that we ordered. But I digress. Anyway, their gratin ancienne was a baked pappardelle dish with b\\u00e9chamel, gruyere, and bacon (so technically yes gratin but also hm).\\n\\nCroque monsieur was very tasty - not too salty, perfect amount of cheese on top, and the nicely toasted bread paired very nicely with the savoury ham. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the croque madame available for dinner (only the croque forestier otherwise) but this was a great choice regardless.\\n\\nThe dauphinois was my favourite dish. Potatoes were soft yet crispy on the top, and the butter/cream sauce was very rich (definitely on the heavy and salty side for sure, but still not bad).\\n\\nThe pasta dish was... understandably... very similar to the potatoes au gratin. The thick chunks of bacon were very rich and I thought presented a nice contrast to the b\\u00e9chamel sauce (yeah no kidding - there was a Very Heavy layer of b\\u00e9chamel). Overall, not bad as well - it was also a bit too heavy for my taste, but would recommend if they have this special again.\\n\\nAll in all, a rather satisfying meal, and for less than expected (although nowadays who knows how much going out to eat *should* cost anymore?) Will definitely be back - I'd love to try their lunch/brunch menus sometimes (much less looking forward to the looming sceptre of long queues..) We stumbled upon Buvette while looking for a place to eat lunch in Greenwich Village and we LOVED it. The cocktail menu was extensive and the drinks were excellent. The food was also delicious, and there was something for everyone, even those unfamiliar with French cuisine. The ambiance was very cozy and our waiter was very friendly. Highly recommend! We we're seated quickly on a Monday night when I sodi and via Carota were over an hour wait.\\n\\nI love French food and buvette didn't disappoint. We had the dauphinois as an appetizer and it was delicious. Subtle cheese and potato goodness.\\n\\nThe beef bourguignon special for $18 was delicious, it was served with four pieces of bread to slurp up the good stuff. The con here was the two pieces of potato and two pieces of carrot were nearly hard/undercooked.\\n\\nThe bleu cheese burger was served on a focaccia-like bun, nothing special overall. Didn't have the hearty beef flavor I was hoping.\\n\\nCome for the drink menu. Their mixologist's are pretty amazing and more than that the ingredients and drink creations were impressive.\\n\\nDon't miss the Apple tartine-pretty unreal! The chocolate mousse was satisfying, but liked the fresh whipped cream more.\\n\\nThe portion sizes are on the smaller size so factor that in when ordering. My beef arrived in a wee lil pot.\\n\\nLastly, there were lots of staff, water was solidly filled, mostly efficient except weren't asked if we wanted another cocktail and our waiter brought our dishes out separately and we had to wait for the rest. He told us they came from separate kitchens. Cute, buzzy bistro with good vibes! My friend and I only waited in line for a few minutes before getting seated at the bar on a Sunday morning. It was pretty crowded inside, but that's part of what gave the restaurant a lively charm.\\n\\nThe food was good - I ordered the waffle sandwich and my friend got a salmon scramble, and then we shared a chocolate almond croissant. The waffle was yummy, but it was a pretty small portion for the price. I liked my friend's dish better - it seems like the egg-based menu items are the heartier ones.\\n\\nGood place to come for brunch with a friend if the wait isn't too bad! \\uff0a Pain Perdu\\nThe brioche bread was extremely soft and bathed in the creme anglaise, garnished with blueberries and raspberries. I enjoyed the french toast a lot, but $18 with only 1 slice of bread was skimpy. I prefer getting French toasts elsewhere with decent portion or making one at home myself.\\n\\n\\uff0a Jambon Cru\\nBuvette's steamed egg is famous for a reason - their scrambled eggs was extremely fluffy and creamy. There were a great amount of prosciutto dusted with shaved parmesan flakes over 2 slices of sourdough toast. The prosciutto stood out from the ones you got from supermarket.\\n\\nI would love to go back for the cozy French vibes and quality brunch food, but the line and the pricing made me hesitate. We were shocked when we saw the palm-sized small plates. I don't have a big appetite but the servings were really small and the price was unreasonably high.\\n\\n\\uff0a Latte, Cappuccino w/ Oat Milk\\nTheir coffee were good enough to serve as a great accompaniment of your brunch plates. Love the Buvette logo printed on the cappuccino mug, very classy. Great food, great service and nice ambience. However, this is not the place for you if you're looking for a more intimate setting. The line to get in (brunch hours) was intimidating at first but it went by quickly. Cute brunch spot with a unique menu. We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated & they only had outdoor seating. It was cold & we were skeptical, but they have a really nice heated covered area, & we stayed warm during our session. Our server was nice & attentive. Food was really good. The soft scrambled eggs were spectacular & so was the waffle sandwich (not too sweet, not too salty, perfectly balanced) SUCH a cute brunch place with delicious food. I highly recommend getting their eggs, as they are whipped up to be so fluffy and delicious. Our eggs paired perfectly with their toast and fresh smoked salmon. Our waffle was also delicious as well, topped with fresh berries, cream, and jam. The service was very quick and we did not have to wait long at all to be seated, despite there being a line. My one qualm is that we each paid $6 for regular coffee and were told there were no refills. They saved us. We were wondering around checking if any restaurant would seat us walk ins for dinner in the neighborhood and every where was packed. We were seated as soon as we got there. The food was so good but I heard they are known for their brunch menu. Would definitely come again to try their brunch menu. 100 percent recommend. idk what I expected but the whole experience was kinda funny, I mean the portions were tiny, the tables were tiny, the space was tiny, I felt like I was in alice in wonderland\\n\\nFOOD - each dish was different than I expected in but it was ok....\\nbrandade de morue - surprisingly rlly liked the cod, it's like a buttery cod spread and they give u a couple pieces or super hard bread.\\n\\ncoq au vin - chicken pieces were juicy and soft and yummy. rest of the vegetables were normal except the fact that I don't like chickpeas and olives so I had to avoid them\\n\\nPRICE - the portion sizes were tiny, like girl dinner size\\n\\nSERVICE - a bit slow\\n\\nAMBIANCE - tiny seats and tiny table next to busy af stairway. a little annoying but whatever Line tends to be pretty long on weekends but goes quick if you have a small group. Love sitting outside on a nice fall day.\\n\\nI've had the croque monsieur and the croque forestier and both were delicious albeit a bit heavy. Would have benefited from an acidic side. Aviation was well done. Overall will return! Love this cute little French spot in town! The egg toast was so fluffy and tasty, the orange juice and elixir juice were super fresh. I am obsessed with the interior decoration and the little menu they have! Would definitely come back for another brunch date with friends!! Knocked a star off becoz of the price & the tiny portion. Otherwise it's easily a four star because the food is pretty good and everything is very French!\\n\\n~ Pain Perdu ~\\nVery very tiny piece of French toast, just about larger then palm size, tasted very good though! Brioche bun is golden crispy with a soft and custardy inside. The creme anglaise is very light, creamy and not sweet at all, the brioche soaks up all the sauce yum.\\n\\n~ Jambon Cru ~\\nIt may look simple, but tasted very good! The scrambled eggs are super creamy and fluffy, prosciutto looks and tasted premium with the deep pink colour, very fragrant and flavourful. The toast is soft and moist too.\\n\\nWill I be back? Maybe\\nWhilst the food are good, I wouldn't say I am enormously impressed or wow'd. Especially consider the potion and price... $18 for a larger the palm size french toast is not justifiable. Most restaurants would be giving at least 2 pieces, or just a giant one double in size. If you want a light but delicious breakfast, you HAVE to come here. The eggs are so fluffy and the flavors tie everything together. We will definitely be back Food was great. The ambiance is cute, doesn't feel like you're in NYC. Service could definitely be better. Very pleased with overall experience here. Came for brunch. Was prepared to wait a bit if necessary, but when we got here, the line wasn't too long. Shortly after arriving, we were given the opportunity to be seated right away at the bar. We decided to wait for a table, since it was our first time, thinking we would have more space to just \\\"spread out\\\" and relax.\\n\\nThe line moved smoothly, and we were eventually seated inside near the bar. It's a small, but cozy restaurant. Our table was very small. First thought was if one were to order a lot of food, there was no way it'd all fit on the table.\\n\\nI ordered the Jambon Cru with a scone and an americano. My husband ordered the Ch\\u00e8vre with a latte. The items arrived in a timely manner. The espresso drinks came first, and they were well prepared; nothing to complain about here.\\n\\nThe Jambon and Ch\\u00e8vre came on small plates that were perfectly sized for the table. The steamed eggs were fabulous! It had soft cooked eggs on toast that was light and a perfect companion. The prosciutto gave it a nice salty bite. As an egg lover, the meal was a great experience for me. Loved it!\\n\\nIt can be described as a perfect meal, including the size. We weren't stuffed, and it left room for dessert or another snack if desired (as we like to try different things when visiting an area). As a runner, I do have a hearty appetite, so on a day I'd have run, the meal may have been a bit too small. But this day, it was perfect. The scone, however, was underwhelming, and I wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nI loved the place and see myself returning whenever back in NYC. Talk about an intimate setting! The poster child for west village vibes in NYC this place is great. The cocktail menu is massive and the food menu is super cute. Cannot go wrong with anything you order here. Fast service and expensive but still reasonable food and drinks. Phenomenal date spot but also good for any occasion. The French onion soup was incredible and the mussels are a staple on their menu Came for brunch on a Saturday for two people. As many reviewers have said, expect a line. Unfortunately you can't just put your number down and wander, you have to physically wait in line and a host will periodically come out and seat parties based on what's available. The line does move faster than you'd expect. I do NOT recommend coming here with more than 4ish people, as the restaurant is narrow and many tables are two toppers.\\n\\nI've been here a few times and all in all it's good, but some of the food is hit or miss and nothing really stands out. What you come here for is the entire experience - the restaurant is an iconic neighborhood gem, charming and quaint inside. But I personally don't think it's worth waiting for more than 20 minutes to be seated.\\n\\nOrdered the below (portions are definitely small!)\\n\\n-Almond Croissant: order comes with two. Not the best I've had, but still tasty.\\n\\n-Croque Monsieur: the best thing we ordered. Petite in size, but delicious. I would come back for this.\\n\\n-Jambon Cru: this has potential. Even with the prosciutto, the eggs needed more cheese / salt / pepper. They were bland. But I will say, the texture was perfect: pillowy and soft. This is a tiny order so if you're hungry you may also want something in addition.\\n\\n-Waffle Sandwich: this was the biggest disappointment. I do not recommend. It was soggy, proportions were off (too much waffle and only one piece of bacon), and overall just didn't taste that good. We went at 10:15 on a Sunday morning. We didn't have to wait at all, got seated outside immediately but inside was packed and only 1 more open table outside. Tables are small and seating is cramped.\\nI had the Croque Forestier and my husband had Jambon Cru. We also had a scone to share. Scone was nice - it came heated with alittle butter and orange marmalade. I prefer other types of jam but it was very good.\\nMy croque forestier was very delicious, cheese was nicely melted and had nice flavor all the way thru. My husband really liked his jambon cru although his eggs looked alittle under for my tastes.\\nI would come back. I had heard great things about buvette, especially about the chicken salad so I was excited to try for myself. the restaurant itself is really cute but I would be prepared to wait on the weekendsaumon fum\\u00e9 [$17]: I didn't looove this dish. it was fine and I could see certain people liking it but it was very wet. the eggs were cooked more on the under done side which was fine but they made the bread quite soggy. if you have issues with texture, this may not be the dish for you! but the quality of ingredients was goodsalade de poulet [$22]: this salad was pretty large and I would say the leaves and the chicken and ingredients in general were fresh. all ingredients were cold which was fine when it came to the veggies and protein but I kind of wish the potatoes were warm or crispy to give it some variety! BUVETTES is one of those places that makes you feel like the main character.\\n\\nWe went to this very popular West Village establishment on a very rainy Saturday morning around 9:30am. We waited around 10 minutes and were sat outside. The outdoor seating is cute/covered & they are on a side street so it feels European.\\n\\nWe got cappuccinos & waffles with eggs & bacon. These waffles were insanely good. They were crispy on the outside & had a really sweet vanilla bean flavor. It went perfectly with the eggs & bacon. The Capp was okay- I've had better. But truly it isn't about the food- it is about the place. It all feels so Parisian that eating at Buvettes feels like a celebration.\\n\\nThe service left a lot to be desired- somewhat short & seemed agitated. They also really push you in & out of the restaurant.\\n\\nHowever, I would certainly return for brunch or dinner or drinks or anything. It's a taste of France in the west village & the restaurant experience feels special. I first heard about this place when Sofia Coppola (a local, I believe) mentioned it in an interview a few years ago. Buvette has 5 other locations in Europe, Asia and Mexico. The West Village location is quite compact and tight but full of charm, does not accept reservations. The pandemic outdoor patio has greatly increased seating capacity. I was able to walk in without a wait around 10:30 am on a weekday.\\n\\nI ordered simply: a croque monsieur and a house-made ginger soda. The soda was quite refreshing. The croque was fine but on the dry side; I've had croques elsewhere with a bechamel sauce that helps. I perhaps should have ordered the croque madame (with an egg), which I think is the same price.\\n\\nNevertheless, the place is very cute and quite popular, a solid West Village choice. Plus, the apartment building seen in the still-popular TV show \\\"Friends\\\" is on the same street. Long line for brunch! Line moved fairly quick. They do not do reservations. They have a little outdoor seating and some indoor seating as well. I loved the avocado toast. Super fresh avocado and beautiful poached egg. Their menu is fairly small so definitely take a look before coming. The portion sizes are also not large. This place is such a vibe and transported me back to Europe. It's very busy and I don't believe they take reservations, so expect to wait in line.\\n\\nAlthough, I don't drink coffee.. my friend says this is one of his favorite spots. And their coffee is very good.\\n\\nI paid $18 for a waffle. It was delish but definitely pricey. However, I did have my first celebrity sighting of Joe Jonas! $18 well spent. Haha A very solid 3/5, but I could could see it being better on a different day.\\n\\nI think my Buvette experience was a bit diminished due to the crazy construction going on in front of the restaurant-- it was so loud you could hear it from the back patio, and when my friend called to let me know she was close by, she couldn't even hear me. This combined with their walk-in seating system--where you have to stand on the sidewalk (no waitlist), and if the entire party is not there, they will not seat you-- was pretty unpleasant. But I can see how it would be much nicer when there's no construction.\\n\\nService was good and ambiance inside was cute, but we were seated in their back patio area, which was cramped, kind of chilly, and had a really persistent wasp. We got les oeufs with jambon and with salmon and capers. The eggs are a soft scrambled egg on thick toast with their indicated toppings. You could definitely make these at home by watching the Gordon Ramsey egg tutorial. To be sure, they are good, but also they're not worth $18. Will be back if a friend really wants to go or if someone else if paying, but not otherwise. Visited Buvette with a plan to come in early to avoid an agonizing wait and it was a success lol\\n\\nWe arrived at 9:45am on a sunday and were seated at the bar in 10mins (it wouldve been a longer wait for a regular table indoors for two) .It wasnt such a bad spot actually. Noise was average but the volume was a little less by the bar I guess coz it was facing away from the rest of the crowd. Service was pleasant and efficient.\\n\\nWe got our almond croissant first and it was one of the best that Ive had in a while - some crunch from crust and the almonds but soft in the center. And there is sweetness there too which I liked! The latte was very good and I also liked their Cafe Meil (has cinnamon). For the food we got the Jambon Cru which had nice soft scrambled eggs! I love the texture and the mild clean flavor of the eggs. Add with some pepper, prosciutto and parmesan and it was actually a lovely breakfast. The Belgian waffle was surprisingly good too! Fruits were fresh, waffle was soft and the creme fraiche actually elevated that flavor!\\n\\nThe breakfast/brunch menu was really just something simple but I liked how they actually executed the whole dish and kept the flavor just so pleasant. Thats probably why I ended up giving the five stars after debating if it shouldve been a four. Anyway hubster agrees a 5 star is in order and so there you have it. The line is so long! Thankfully my friend and I went a bit early on Saturday around 11am. There was a staff that came out to the line to ask the number of party. We got lucky since there was available outdoor seating.\\n\\nOrdered the following. The images below does not show the true size. The actual size of the orders are extremely small portions -_-\\n- Jambon Cru $17 Egg with prosciutto with shaved Parmesan: The eggs were not seasoned at all and so watery. The bread was stale and hard to eat.\\n- Almond croissant $8: The smallest croissants I have ever seen for this price. Definitely not worth it! It was hard and not flaky.\\n- Cappuccino $6.50: Nothing special.\\n\\nIn terms of service, no one came to check on our table and when someone refilled our water, it splattered and the staff didn't even care. Overall, did not have a great experience. Cute and cozy French breakfast restaurant. Fresh coffee and everything made perfectly. Buvette made for a lovely brunch with my bestie. We made last minute reservations and were able to grab a slot at noon indoors!\\n\\nI ordered the Croque (\\\"CRQ\\\") Monsieur which came as two mini sandwiches. The bechamel was super creamy and made this croque a favorite. My friend ordered the Jambon Cru (minus the jambon since she's a vegetarian). Her soft scrambled eggs looked amazing over the toast. She had nothing but good things to say. We had our brunch with Morning Elixer, a green juice.\\n\\nThe server was super friendly and let us take our time to order and eat. It was a nice catch up with my friend including a delicious brunch in beautiful West Village. If I ever go back to New York, I will have to try their waffles. Cheers! MY. FAVE. BRUNCH. SPOT. OF . ALL. TIME\\nI get so excited just talking about this place. I have nothing negative to say and everything we ordered was so good, with the exception with one (which I'll explain below). Overall, this place has the BEST almond croissant, and that's a MUST GET. I see why that always gets sold out. We came here without a resy, and only had to wait for 15mins outside which really isn't bad, considering it's super hard to get a resy here normally.\\n\\n1. Croque Madame: this was sooo Devine! It was so flavorful and delicious, just pure perfection. First time having the croque madame and now I can't get enough\\n\\n2. Belgian waffle: 10/10. The waffle was so soft and fluffy, and literally just melts in your mouth. The presentation is also on point!\\n\\n3. Their croissants are out of this world! Try to get it right out of the oven, and it's literally so godly. Seriously the best croissants I've had in the city so far (still have yet to find a place that tops this)\\n\\n4. The only thing that was a slight disappointment compared to everything else we got was the jambon cru. I thought it was kind of lacking in the flavors, BUT this could be due to the fact that my friend is avoiding dairy so he didn't want cheese on the eggs... which could have contributed to the lack of flavors.\\n\\nAmbiance: very crowded, and the space is tight. Cute brunch place tho!\\n\\nService: great service. Loved our waitress. Best. Brunch. Ever.\\n\\nI'm salivating thinking about this meal again\\n\\nThe croque madame was the best I've ever had, the pain perdu was indulgent, and the warm cider was the perfect beverage to top everything off. I love this place, I could eat here every morning, and will be doing my best to grab a bite here every trip to New York.\\n\\nIf you can get your hands on a reservation here DO IT, you won't regret it!! Do not let the line deter you! The line moves rather quickly and it will be worth it!\\n\\nThe restaurant is small but it sure does utilize every square inch. Workers are constantly moving so keep your arms tucked in if you're sitting next alongside the aisle. We were amazed at how many workers there were! It sure does keep the restaurant running smoothly. It's safe to say that the service was excellent.\\n\\nEverything was made to perfection. I love how small the almond croissants were, which allowed for a full flavor profile with each bite. And don't worry, it comes with two to an order! The fresh squeeze OJ was definitely worth the $11; it comes with lots of pulp, which I love.\\n\\nMy fianc\\u00e9 ordered the Jamon Cru, which he said was delicious. The eggs were so fluffy, it reminds me of the Gordon Ramsey eggs we make at home. There was also a good portion of jamon. And last but not least I got the waffle sandwich, which was our favorite. It was so simple yet so delicious. The waffle was quite soft and buttery, and I generally like a crispy waffle to start, so I was pleasantly surprised. The bacon and egg balanced the sweetness of the waffle just right. I honestly cannot wait to go back once I'm back in NYC! Breakfast go-to spot in the city. Their almond croissants are my favorite and the ch\\u00e8vre scrambled eggs are phenomenal.\\n\\nThis spot is perfect for an early morning espresso and good company. I came here during my last visit to NYC with a friend and sat outdoors with some breakfast to share and it was perfect. Service is always great and if it's not too busy you'll be seated without a reservation easily.\\n\\nDon't miss out on this gem! I am extremely impressed with Buvette!\\n\\nThis is a VERY popular spot. When we arrived, the line was out the door and getting longer by the second. We had a reservation but weren't able to make it in time. I explained the situation to the hostess, and she made her best to accommodate us, without affecting the people who were waiting in line.\\n\\nThe only spot open was at the bar, right next to the serving station so we got to see the entire process of the restaurant. Orders coming in, being prepared, being sent to the tables... The \\\"kitchen\\\" is right there at the bar. They have some small ovens, the steamed eggs are done with the steamer of a coffee machine. The espresso, tea, and all drinks are made to order, and each section has assigned staff working very organized as a choreographed dance.\\n\\nThey all worked hard and in unison to get all orders out as quickly as possible, making sure everyone is satisfied but also trying to keep the line outside moving as fast as they can.\\n\\nAs busy as they were, I could see them putting all their effort in every dish. Presentation is important to them too. Several coffees would drip onto the saucer dish, and they immediately replaced it with a clean one. Everything comes out of that kitchen perfectly presented and to order.\\n\\nHighly recommend the almond croissants and any egg dish on the menu. I assure you will not be disappointed, and if you forget to make reservations, the wait is very well worth it. Every morning I walk past Buvette, I see a long line of people waiting. Decided to come try Buvette for brunch with some visiting friends. We went around 11:00 AM on a Saturday and there was already a line of around 4-5 parties ahead of us. We got seated outside on a cold day (party of 3) within 20 minutes.\\n\\nWe ordered the croque madame, Belgian waffle, and salmon + egg to share between 3 people. Prices were about $18 each dish. The food looked great, but there was a very small amount given the price point. The waffle and salmon + egg weren't anything special, but the flavors of the croque madame were great and the best part of the meal. The drinks were also very good.\\n\\nThe servers were nice but overall the food did not stand out too much to us. I would give Buvette five stars if the seating were not absurdly uncomfortable. Diners are seated so closely together that you are likely to brush a plate on the table of the diner' seated beside you with your coat, and tables need to be moved in order to allow your neighbor to exit or visit the restroom. Private conversation is utterly impossible with the noise level being extremely high. Not a relaxed experience and it is in poor taste to pack diners in like tinned sardines in order to maximize profit with disregard for the comfort of the diner. That said, the dishes were delicious, soft scrambled eggs with truffle and grilled bread were wonderful, mimosas were perfect, the cappuccinos also perfect. The decor absolutely charming with elegant detail, service friendly, professional, and attentive. I've been to Buvette a few times now, always walk-ins early or on weeknights.\\n\\nCan't go wrong with any of the dishes but the chicken salad with dijon dressing is a classic. The steak tartare is also phenomenal as expected. The reviews were all right & I wish I had trusted. Service was good though they messed up our order.\\nThe food is not great. I'm starting to think French food just isn't known for good food. Merguez was bland watery, the coq au vin soo salty & not flavorful and rubbery. As others said...trust us. Definitely wanted food elsewhere after I couldn't eat any of that food.\\nNow, the carrots rapees were AMAZING. I contemplated ordering 2 more rounds of that. What a combination of flavor....very good & presented as a pretty tower.\\nThe chocolate mousse was good.\\nThe environment for dinner was nice. If you don't like crowded tight spaces where you may touch strangers next to you, you will be bothered here. But I appreciated the closeness it felt cultured, authentic.\\nI'll say it's in a great neighborhood. I may return for carrots but for the price not sure.\\nGo, enjoy Tasty traditional French small plates in a charming space with a drink menu booklet that you'll feel like a dork taking pictures of. Excellent service. Arrived around 6:40pm on a Friday and were seated right away, although only a few tables were available. Buzzing atmosphere, but not too loud to hold a conversation.\\n\\nHachee au Jambon Cru and Petits Pois tartines were good. Seafood special of the day was good. Carottes Rapees were good, though shredded, not julienned as advertised.\\n\\nFair price, would return. I don't understand why or how this place is so popular. They are way better brunch places in Manhattan. The seating is horrible; there is no personal space. You're sharing tables with strangers. The food portion is super small, and you cannot add or remove anything, meaning the food is pre-made. This place just sucks, IMO. Make sure to make a reservation because this spot is busy!! Buvette has been on my yelp bookmarks for who knows how long and I am so glad to say we finally tried it!\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\nFresh squeezed orange juice - while insanely expensive ($11), the orange juice was delicious. It was so pulpy, sweet, and refreshing!\\n\\nCroque Monsieur - my favorite of the meal! The edges of the cheese crusted perfectly, the insides were melty and the ham was chopped for easy eating, and it was overall just so yummy. It was very bready, but also very filling, and the pickles were perfect to cut through the heaviness.\\n\\nSaumon Fum\\u00e9 - the smoked salmon on this dish was really good but other than that, it wasn't that special to me. The eggs were kind of plain but it went well with the saltiness of the salmon.\\n\\nThis restaurant is a bit pricey, but ultimately you're also paying for the atmosphere and the aesthetic. And the good service! If you are looking for the perfect spot for an incredible cup of coffee and the worlds best scone with marmalade look no further. Or if your looking for the worlds best \\\"scrambled\\\" eggs or the cheesiest Croque Madame you've ever had...again, this is your joint! We've also tried their chocolate mousse since apparently they don't offer wine and cheese until dinner time. Today we stopped in at 2p and opted for some red wine and chocolate mousse. In one word, perfection!!!! They top the chocolate mousse with fresh made slightly sweetened whipped cream. The pinot we selected paired well with the chocolate.\\n\\nBuvette takes reservations but we typically wander up around opening and they always greet us with a smile and welcome us in. We like to sit outside as it's SO pleasant and fun to people watch. They do have warmers to keep you toasty if you are worried about getting cold.\\n\\nThe ambiance inside is typically French. What's that mean? Idk...it reminds me of a bistro I've visited in Paris only this place is bigger, nicer and in my favorite city of all times!!\\n\\nI'd like to add a note, going back tomorrow night for cheese and I saw they have hot spiced wine (like gluwine in Austria)!!! I mention cheese yet again because they have an amazing selection...just have to go at the right hour which I suspect is dinner hours... This place seems to be popular for brunch, but I went for dinner with a few friends and decided to split several dishes:\\n\\n- Escargots: 6 large pieces cooked in garlic, parsley & butter. The melted garlic butter was great for dipping.\\n- Cassoulet: a small bowl (more like a \\\"cup\\\" in terms of portion size) filled with tarbais beans and maybe three pieces of meat (duck, pork, and sausage I think). Standard comfort food.\\n- Betteraves: just your regular beets... the horseradish creme fraiche went well with the beets, but this is not a must order dish.\\n- Artichauts a la grecque: artichoke braised in wine, garlic & mint. Not super memorable.\\n- Brandade de morue: house salt cod with olive oil, cream & garlic. This was probably our favorite. Amazing with bread.\\n- Three glasses of wine (friends asked for recommendations from our server)\\n\\nCame out to around $50pp. Dishes here are super small. Not sure if I would return for dinner as the only thing I would want to have again is the Brandade and maybe the escargots. If you time your arrival just right you will get lucky and get sat immediately. My husband and I went in around 930am on a Thursday & got immediately sat at the bar. We had quick service and friendly smiles from the bartenders who were eager to help assist us. We had a hard time selecting what to eat as everything sounded wonderful.\\n\\nWe ended up with the jambon cru + the chevre. The jambon cru is something i am not dreaming about and will go back in the neat future to have again.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm glad I live close to here so I can bop by and try to secure a sacred seat within. I love this spot for a quick bite or drink with friends. They have an extensive wine and cocktail program with various specials each night. Its cozy inside and feels like youre in someone's dining room. They have a lot of out of the box items on their menu but if you can score their burger special it is incredible with a nice glass of french wine. Buvette is such a cute restaurant! I heard this is one of the most iconic brunch spots in New York City and I was excited for the visit! My friends and I arrived in the afternoon and there was a long line of people. Looks like party of 1's are quite popular here and they get seated quick at the bar. While on the line, there was a cute Buvette bike parked at one of the poles.\\n\\nMy friends and I shared the following dishes: Chocolate Croissants, Saumon Fume, Jambon Cru, and CRQ Forestier. The Chocolate Croissants were really good! I love how flaky it is on the outside and the dark chocolate on the inside. We originally wanted the Almond Croissant but it was sold out, get here early to get it! Saumon Fume was also really good. I love how fluffy the scrambled eggs and the smoked salmon was just the perfect pairing! I would totally get it again! The popular Jambon Cru also had fluffy eggs and the prosciutto was good. I did think the dish was lacking, perhaps, it needs more flavor or seasoning. CRQ Forestier was heavy! It had intense aroma and flavors of mushroom and gruyere cheese and tomatoes. This dish was good but was a bit too heavy for my taste. Portions look like they are for one person, not too big.\\n\\nI enjoyed my brunch experience here and would come back for the croissants and the Saumon Fume! Buvette has been at the top of my list for awhile and finally I made it for lunch. The menu is very small and it's not cheap - just be prepared. The service is nothing special. It's really slow but the people are nice.\\n\\nCappuccino: 5/10\\n\\nWeak coffee. The foam was thin, not very frothy. Not worth the price at all.\\n\\nChocolate Croissant: 3/10\\n\\nYou're a French restaurant and you call it a \\\"chocolate croissant\\\"... that should have been my first indication. These tasted like they were bought at a grocery store. They were small and big fluffy or flakey at all. They were dense. Not what I wanted at all.\\n\\nBetteraves (beets): 9/10\\n\\nI love beets - call me crazy. These were cooked perfectly! They were too hard or soft and the shallot and horseradish cr\\u00e8me was delicious on top! Quite a simple dish and small but the cr\\u00e8me was special.\\n\\nSaumon Fum\\u00e9 (steamed eggs with smoked salmon and cr\\u00e8me fraiche): 10/10\\n\\nThis is why we come folks. The eggs do not have anything in them but a little bit of salt and pepper and are prepared in a way that makes them extremely fluffy. They just fill your mouth with happiness. The smoked salmon, toasted bread with olive oil, and cr\\u00e8me fraiche were all such a perfect combination.\\n\\nTuna Salad: 8/10\\n\\nA very interesting combination of items but together it was very refreshing. I think the green beans could have been cut up so everything was cut up and bite sized. The tuna salad tasted very fresh. I enjoyed it.\\n\\nOverall definitely worth going to for a more than casual meal. Don't expect incredible service but do expect good food. And please get the eggs! After a much needed steam in the equinox down the block, I decided to extend the weekend after a day of eating leftover \\\"American Super Bowl\\\" food. I stumbled into Buvette and tried both desserts. The presentation could have passed for food in a dog bowl. After eating, I wouldn't even let my dog try it. Never get the dessert here. Excellent friendly service. We had a great waitress. Alina. Great atmosphere. Food was on point. But warning. A lot of bread involved. Every dish was not too much but just right. Great wine selection and desserts. Buvette may have just taken the crown for my favorite latte in NYC.\\n\\nI really loved the ode to France that comes through in the ambiance. The space feels cozy, charming, and inviting.\\n\\nAs for the food -- it's great. Not much more to comment on in that regard. It's the coffee and the vibe that stayed with me.\\n\\nThe service was sufficient too! Buvette has been on my bucket list for a long time coming, but I had always been super intimidated by the long lines. On the off chance that I was in the city on a weekday, I was able to try the brunch here.\\n\\nThere is a longer wait for outdoor seating, about 20 minutes, but I was able to be seated inside within 5 minutes of waiting on the line. There is a reason why the outdoor seating is preferred: the tables inside are REALLY tiny and packed tightly. The table for two honestly is comfortable for a single person, and the table for 4 is more of a table for 2. I had to watch my drink when people were moving in and out between tables or it would be knocked over quite easily. On the other hand, the tables outside are slightly bigger and more spaced out.\\n\\nAs for food, the brunch options are fabulous and quintessentially French. I highly recommend the steamed eggs, that was actually what drew me here to begin with (curse you Instagram!). Apparently they are made using the steamer from the espresso machine. I tried the eggs with prosciutto and it was delicious, albeit the portions are smaller than expected. It is served over 2 thin slices of bread and topped with 2 slices of prosciutto and shaved parmesan. The plate it is served on is an appetizer plate, not a dinner plate, just to give you an idea of size.\\n\\nI also got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice (you can literally hear the juicer running in the background, which makes it quite noisy indoors) and while it was expensive, but sweet and full of pulp. I liked how it came in this cute little pitcher and a glass that is barely bigger than a shot glass.\\n\\nOverall, I am glad I got to try the steamed eggs and had a pleasant experience. Next time I would like to try the croquet madame (and perhaps, wait a bit longer for the outdoor seating if the weather is still nice). I went for Saturday brunch taking my chances in waiting. Surprisingly the wait wasn't that long. The line moved pretty quickly. Btw, they won't tAke you unless all the party members arrive. The restaurant itself is tiny but very cute in its own way. Very small waiting area for the bathroom. Okay the food.. I had Jambon cru. The scrambled egg was dry and cool. Maybe it was supposed to be. \\u200d. The portion was okay. Wish the food came out with some side of greens as I felt like I needed some acid while eating the egg and porsciutto. And I've had better ice coffee.\\nI wish I had tried their pastries before I left. Would I go back again? Probably not. Once was enough. Great ambiance and a perfect dress-up brunch aesthetic. Food took a little too long to arrive, but when it did it was quite delicious! Not very many menu options, but they do have a range of sweet and savory that mostly satisfies the brunch range. Great espresso as well! Soooo yummy. Would skip the croissants but the pain perdu was incredible. It was so fresh & light unlike anything I've ever had. The fresh berries really enhanced the experience. The crq Madame was equally as good. Make a resy but weekdays are slower in the mornings! Yes it's a little overrated. Yes it's a little overpriced.\\n\\nBut the food is fantastic and the atmosphere is too.\\n\\nI like coming here for an early breakfast on a weekday, because I prefer not to wait in the enormous lines that ensue in the later morning, especially on the weekends.\\n\\nThe egg dishes are smooth and creamy and buttery and the highlight for sure. the food is reaaaaly good but the portions are tiny and its soooo expensive. its also hard to find a table but the outdoor seating is often fine Breakfast was delicious, scone is nice and warm . I sat outside , nice and shady , this is a one way street , but it wasn't too noisy. The staff are friendly and fast Nice spot for brunch and if you're in the mood for French cuisine! My party of 6 waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning without a reservation, which is not bad considering how many other parties I saw waiting as well. The inside space was a bit small, so the table area wasn't too roomy. All their items were delicious and filling, even if it may not look to big upon serving. I also got a hot cafe miel which is basically a latte with honey and cinnamon - would recommend this if you're looking for a twist on a traditional latte. This is a quintessential neighborhood caf\\u00e9/restaurant nestled in a beautiful street. Coffee, food were not only delicious, but reasonably priced. This is a perfect place for two friends to catch up after many years. Food lives up to the hype. Best food I've eaten in years. Ambience is instagram worth, for sure. Staff is friendly. Be sure to go to the bathroom! So cute\\n\\nWe ordered the waffle sandwich, pain perdue (French toast), CRQ madame and a cappuccino. $100.\\n\\nThe French toast was eggy and yummy. Brioche bread. The sauce is something you want to lick the plate afterwards but wouldn't because the place is posh. But you want to\\n\\nWaffle sandwich had the best egg my son had ever eaten. I'm insulted a little bit, but I also agree.\\n\\nThe crq is heavy but beyond delicious. It's like an amazing grilled ham & cheese sandwich with an egg and prosciutto on top. Honestly the ham was melt in your mouth yummy.\\n\\nSo glad we went here. Definitely get a reservation One of my favorite brunch spot in NYC. The ch\\u00e8vre eggs was my favorite and so was the jambon cru. The service is okay but they're fast. The place is super small and tight. Not a place to come with a crowd or kids. Buvette has been my go-to spot every time I'm in NYC for brunch as I absolutely love the steamed eggs with toast here. Whether you get it with salmon or prosciutto, it's super creamy and fluffy and amazing on toast. With the creme fraiche, it's the perfect combination to start your day.\\n\\nOf course as many other people have mentioned, Buvette is walk-in only and I have to say, if the weather is decent and there's space, it's much better to sit outside than in the restaurant itself and it's very packed inside. This most recent time we sat right by the stairs and unfortunately because the servers were so busy, we were bumped into a couple of time and it made for a really poor experience.\\n\\nFood is 5/5 but definitely try to get a good seat to allow yourself more space. Always our \\\"go to\\\" for brunch in the West Villlage. Always crowded but always delicious. Best french toast and Waffles in the city and worth every second of the 30 min wait on sundays! The best vibes in this restaurant! We sat at the bar and it was so enjoyable watching the bartenders make cocktails all night. The cocktails are some of the best I've had in nyc and the French food was fantastic! It really feels like you're in a French bistro. Can't wait to come back! I've always wanted to try Buvette and finally made it there for brunch this week!\\n\\nWhen I arrived around 12:30 on Wednesday, I was surprised that there was a line! I knew it was a popular spot but didn't anticipate a line for brunch on a weekday. However, it moved quickly and we were seated within minutes.\\n\\nWe opted to sit outside because it was a nice day. Nobel was our waiter and he couldn't have been nicer! We enjoyed chatting with him throughout our meal.\\n\\nThe Pim's Cup was so refreshing, filled with sliced fruit. I hadn't had Pim's in ages and it was the perfect drink for a warm summer day. For my entree I tried the Jambon Cru. The eggs were the perfect soft scramble and it was topped with prosciutto and shaved Parmesan. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I will definitely be back! TLDR: This is the best eggs I've ever had!\\n\\nBuvette had a line out the door and around the block on a sunday afternoon. But it is worth the wait! Order a latte or juice of choice as you wait for a steamed eggs dish. They are the fluffiest and creamiest eggs you will have.\\n\\nI personally recommend the Proscuitto and Eggs dish as the salt of the meat complements the eggs and toast well. Buvette, nestled in the bustling heart of New York City's West Village, is a charming culinary gem that delivers a taste of Paris with a unique twist. My recent visit to this cozy bistro left me with a warm and delightful dining experience.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nWalking into Buvette feels like stepping into a classic French cafe. The intimate space is adorned with vintage posters, marble tabletops, and a charming bar where you can watch the bartenders craft creative cocktails. The cozy, dimly lit ambiance sets the stage for a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends.\\n\\nService:\\nThe service at Buvette is friendly and attentive. The staff exudes a welcoming attitude and is happy to provide recommendations from the menu. Despite the restaurant's popularity, the service remains efficient and unhurried, allowing diners to savor each moment.\\n\\nFood:\\nBuvette's menu is a delightful fusion of French and Mediterranean flavors, with a focus on small plates and shared dishes. The menu offers an impressive selection of charcuterie, cheeses, and small bites, making it perfect for those who enjoy grazing and sharing. Each dish is thoughtfully crafted with high-quality ingredients.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n- Croque Madame: A classic French sandwich with a perfectly runny egg on top, served with a side of mixed greens.\\n- Escargot: Tender snails in garlic and parsley butter - a true taste of Paris.\\n- Tartines: The open-faced sandwiches are a must-try, with various toppings like smoked salmon and avocado.\\n- Chocolate Mousse: A velvety, indulgent dessert that satisfies any sweet tooth.\\n\\nPrice:\\nWhile Buvette offers reasonably priced small plates, it's easy to accumulate a bill if you explore the menu extensively. However, the quality and creativity of the dishes make it a worthwhile investment for a memorable meal.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Buvette in New York City is a charming escape to a Parisian-inspired culinary haven. Whether you're seeking a cozy spot for a romantic dinner or a delightful brunch with friends, Buvette delivers on flavor, ambiance, and service. It's a reminder that you don't need to travel to France to experience the magic of a traditional French bistro - you can find it right in the heart of Manhattan. Came here for brunch with two friends on a rainy weekend morning. We waited ~30-40 mins in line and were finally seated in the corner of the restaurant. The table was extremely cramped - we were right next to the table to our right and barely had space for our small purses and jackets. I ordered the croque monseur sandwich and my friends both got eggs. The food was pretty good - but don't think it's worth the hype/wait. Probably won't be returning - only because there's tons of other brunch places without the crazy wait. A little slice of France in NYC. Buvette has an absolutely charming atmosphere that totally comes to life on a cool evening or fall afternoon; warm low lighting and a wonderful patio. My favorite dish are the mussels, almost a curry or mustard type flavor with plenty of creamy butter sauce. There is often a line or a short wait, but its worth it and walking around the West Village is a very enjoyable way to wait and get in the cozy mood for your meal :) While I haven't tried the brunch here, I highly recommend the dinner menu! So the first time I went, I gave Buvette 5 stars and raved to everyone I knew about how amazing the steamed eggs with goat cheese were. And the WERE divine!!\\nThis morning went back to try another steamed egg (since now I love steamed eggs), and they were not good. I chose the salmon ones this time. The eggs were overcooked and had the texture of scrambled eggs. The toast didn't have a crunch to it and was more like soggy bread. I left half on my plate when I payed the bill. No one even asked how my dish was after seeing how much I had left. I will not be raving about this place any longer. First time 5 stars. This time, 1 star. I've been wanting to come to this restaurant for a while, and finally made it in over the weekend. The line was pretty long as we waited outside, but it moves relatively quickly. They originally told us it would be about 25 to 30 minute wait, but because we were willing to sit outside in the covered area, we only waited about 10 minutes. The outdoor seating area was covered with heaters, so it made it quite enjoyable. The service was a little slow, but then again they were quite busy. Unfortunately, they did run out of almond croissants, which were a bummer, but the chocolate croissants were really tasty. I highly recommend the brunch but just know that it's not huge portions and they charge about six dollars for a coffee. Other than that I really enjoyed it and I look forward to coming back again. Stopped in and tried a few dishes, soggy eggs was not my cup of tea. Other items were ok and others enjoyed them. Good service in a crowded place. The only problem was waiting for a table outside and no drinks allowed. They threw away our cup of coffee. Loved the whole vibe here, a picture perfect spot in the West Village! Excellent service, food and drinks. We stopped off wine with local cheese, bread and an outstanding ratatouille. We were seated in the sidewalk area, everything was beautifully prepared. This is one of my favorites for having a small plate and a glass of wine at the bar. It's a good place to go alone and walk right in when there is a long wait and a line down the street. The food is delicious and the service prompt. Don't eat too much because there's too much to do in the neighborhood. Walked in on a random weekday afternoon around 12pm and was able to get a seat at the bar with tables available too. By 1:30pm, it was crowded. Opted to sit at the bar for more table space as the tables for two are quite tiny (like being in Paris).\\nHad the Brussels sprouts and the steak tartare to start. The tartare had lots of cornichons that gave it a slight tang, I enjoyed it. The steamed eggs would be a little bland without a salty element so the smoked salmon helped the dish. The croque forestier was great, the end he's were crispy (cheese, mushrooms and bread) while the inside was soft and gooey. The cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was good, the little crispy crepe/ wafer they gave was sooo good with it. The sugar was nice and caramelized. For drinks, the mulled wine was delicious and sweet. The tamarind sing was light and refreshing, I think it's like a tamarind spritz. The boulevardier was quite strong. The absinthe frappe had strong fennel like flavor.\\nThe service was great. The servers constantly refilled our water glasses, cleared our tables( a must because of the small table size) and checked in. Portions are small but really really delicious! It is a non-reservation place that has a bit of a long wait and cramped seating.\\n\\nIt is in a cute side street of NYC, so it isn't crazy loud or busy. We went in the middle of winter but in the spring/summer time the seating outside should be open and nice for a gathering. Buvette is an awesome French restaurant located in the West Village. My wife and I arrive around 9am on a Monday and were able to get a seat inside right away. They do have outdoor seating but it didn't appear to have any heaters. We were seated a small two person table near the stairs. It was a cozy spot. The service was really good and fast. Within a minute we received our menus and were able to order some coffee. A few minutes later we ordered our food. Everything came out quickly. I ordered a caf\\u00e9 au lait and my wife ordered an americano. To eat we had a croque Madame and a pain perdu. The flavors were amazing. The portions are also just the right size. I would love to come back again and try their dinner menu. They were busy on a Saturday around 3pm, but the line moved quick for my group of 3! We waited less than 10 minutes outside without a reservation. The watermelon lemonade special was SO refreshing and the rest of the food was nice comfort food! The croque madame and monsieur were rich but not heavy, and the pain perdu was not overly sweet. The inside is very cute and definitely a bit tight! It's our second visit to Buvette. Our first visit experience was pretty good so decided to visit again. However the food and service this time were quite disappointing. We waited for more than 30mins for our food, and the server kept walking pass our table but had never checked on us for our order. By the time we got our food, they were almost cold. The server suddenly decided to check us after we got our food and kept asking if we were done with our food while obviously we had not. Very rude service and average food. Can here for brunch and absolutely worth the wait!! Classic place to bring out of towners as well as locals Service was wonderful at Buvette, allowing us to sit inside for breakfast when temperatures were not warm outside.\\n\\nWe started with a chocolate almond croissant, which was very lacking in flavor and texture. It was dry at best. Surprisingly, it was one of the worst I had in NYC.\\n\\nThe waffle sandwich was excellent, with a balance of sweet and salty. Perfect \\\"traditional\\\" breakfast item.\\n\\nThe Belgian waffle with their jam/jelly was tremendous. It did not need anything more than the way it was served.\\n\\nCroque Madame was very good. Their bread adds a nice crunch to the dish, and the ham, being close to their prosciutto, makes it even better. The only thing I traditionally prefer is bechamel, which gives it a creamy consistency.\\n\\nJambon Cru was extremely solid. The prosciutto was very flavorful and paired with the best scrambled eggs I've had, also accompanied by the crunchy bread.\\n\\nThe only negative was the smaller portions with high prices, but that was expected. Still worth it, in my opinion.\\n\\nBeware of the $11 lemonade! Buvette was such an amazing experience! We got there last Friday around noon (we didn't have any reservation) and there were many options for seating either outdoors or indoors. We sit inside, most of the tables are more little than a standard square table but this place has its own, French charmed so it all goes with the vibe. We started with some drinks, my boyfriend got a Mimosa and I ordered a Tom Collins. The Mimosa was great! Made with freshly squeezed oranges and the Tom Collins was so refreshing and delicious! To start, we ordered the plain croissant which was smaller than I expected but there were two of them! It came with a little spoon with fresh butter and the most delicious jam. For entrees, we got the Avocado Toast which was so delicious! The bread was fresh, the avocado was creamy and the egg was perfection! The perfect bites! We also ordered the Ch\\u00e8vre Les Oeufs and it was amazing!!!! Again, the bread was freshly baked, and the soft eggs were delicious! The balance of the goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes was incredible! We also share the Belgian Waffles, those were delicious! The fruits were fresh and the cr\\u00e8me, wow! I could have eaten a whole bowl of just that cr\\u00e9eme with fruits! Our server and food runners were so nice! The place is beautiful, the food was delicious and the service was over the top! The service was rude from the very start. The Busser who poured our water refused to answer questions if they had beer and replied with an attitude. The waitress continued this theme of rudeness and answered our questions as if it was an inconvenience when my father was hard of hearing. The tables around us who had been seated after us got their food before us. Our food was very good, the price was right but that was the only redeeming factor. Buvette was super yummy and the vibes were cute! everything is super tiny and makes you feel like you are abroad. the service was amazing. highly recommend dipping the almond croissants in a cappuccino Buvette is a really cute spot and a really popular spot for brunch. The restaurant has benefited from the pandemic because there is a huge outdoor dining structure that has helped the restaurant a lot since the restaurant itself is pretty small. Overall, I found this place to be charming but the food itself was just ok to be honest. Also, I think the design of the paper menu is super cute.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nChocolate Croissants- I thought these were made well, nice chocolate filling with a well made croissant dough. Overall, I thought this was good but to be honest the price kinda bugged me. It was two mini crossaints for $8. Like mini, like 2-3 bites and poof. It almost felt as expensive as eating sushi and I would rather eat sushi lol. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7Zkq9DPA0vFmEp0AZsEPQw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nSaumon Fume- Eggs & smoked Salmon with cr\\u00e8me fraiche & capers. So all the pics on Yelp are the ones with the ham with steamed egg, people you are missing out!!! I thought the best dish was the salmon version with the steamed egg. I thought the smoked salmon added a wonderful saltiness to the underseasoned eggs. I thought the flavor paired well with the eggs and toast. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xoycbbwExQh2KLgsdwRcKQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nJambon Cru- Eggs & Prosciutto with shaved Parmesan. I thought this dish was prettier than it tasted. Honestly I had high hopes since these pictures are all over Yelp but to be honest it was a let down. First, the eggs were just ok, it felt like a soft scrambled egg but I felt it was missing texture, it felt like I was eating egg pudding than scrambled eggs, I guess I prefer there to be more curds when I eat eggs. Second, I thought this was screaming for salt, I know the ham was supposed to help but it didn't, neither did the shaved cheese on top. This is a weird comment for me to make since I am not a big salt person, so for me to say a dish is missing salt then it was seriously underseasoned. But I think if I could get just a plate of that ham by itself I would have been a happy camper, so good. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=akCqI1boqkwLlNC_JsM2IA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nCRQ Forestier- Roasted mushroom & Gruyere. Overall, flavor on this was good but my God was this dish heavy. This came with two halves, there is no way on God's good earth would I have been able to finish this on my own. The mushrooms and gruyere were nice and I loved the pieces of cheese that became crispy but this dish was so heavy and greasy. I liked the flavor of this dish but I wouldn't order it again. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=F6mmtimeruMAUhydRM-6Sg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA After countless recommendations we managed to get to brunch with friends yesterday. After standing in line with expectations of a good experience, we were unfortunately very disappointed.\\n\\nAt first the waitress was unwilling to serve, but there are days like that too to everyone's.\\n\\nWe asked for almond milk, but they don't stock it. Plus the only sweetener they have is sugar?! It's 2023! What about people who don't use sugar in their coffee?!\\n\\nI asked for my salad to get the dressing on the side, but guess what? They only can do without dressing or with dressing! I don't get it! Instead of mixing it in salad I'd like to have it on the side. But not.\\n\\nThe waitress just wanted to rush us and throw us the check. This place was saved in my favorites on Google Maps, but not anymore. Most definitely worth the wait-- If you're looking for the comfortable low din of a cafe, Buvette's bustling vibes hits it on the nose.\\n\\nCoffee was great-- Latte given in a bowl as it should be, and the food provided was hearty & good portion sizes Excellent service. Food portions were adequate. You can tell the orange juice is natural. Highly recommended, it is on the higher side of prices but for me fully worth it. I honestly do not understand why this place has some good reviews maybe there brunch is good I dunno but there dinner is horrible as far as tinny portions 100% true but the food was bland and I'm sorry paying 11 dollars for a glass of grape fruit juice is just insane Amazing, amazing place in the area. There is a reason there are great reviews! They do NOT take reservations. My friends and I arrived around 12 on a Sunday, and the line was already pretty long. We got seated earlier than parties of two, as ours was a party of three and we were able to get seated on the side of a long table where a party of 9 was at.\\n\\nEverything here was so delicious and when we were sitting inside, it felt like we weren't in New York.. but in like.. Europe? Servers were attentive and our drinks and food came out very fast. We saw so many pictures of Jambon Cru and decided to order it and it was SO DELICIOUS!! Highly recommend. The texture, the flavor, the presentation, everything was amazing.\\n\\nI would love to come back here and try their other drinks and dishes. Would keep this place bookmarked for sure! Beautiful and charming place for breakfast or brunch (I moved to NYC from Paris so I know what I'm talking about :)\\nThe food was good but the portions are so so tiny and overpriced!\\nStuff is very friendly and the waiting line goes very quickly so don't be scared ;) On a busy Saturday evening in the Village, after a movie at the Angelika, fending for vittles because I failed to make dinner reservations. Whisking past long lines and 2-hour waits, we were pleasantly surprised and exuberant to be seated right away when we asked the waiter sauntering by us outdoors how long the wait would be.\\n\\nI ordered Cassoulet, the special of the day. My friend got the Oysters in curry sauce, topped with fries. Both came in small single-serving porcelain crocks, which we appreciated since so many restaurants go bonkers with portion size. They brought complimentary fresh bread. The food was very good; my friend especially enjoyed the flavorful curry, its spiciness softened by the bread.\\n\\nThe interior is nicely arranged and decorated. Tight quarters with tables so closely spaced they can accommodate a smile but not a big butt, but hey it's lower Manhattan so that's the norm.\\n\\nService was expertly efficient. The server's French accent and good looks were a bonus. I would give a leg to dine here again. The perfect meal when you stumble upon somewhere and it hits all points from start to finish. Service, food, ambience, they have it all. So I ended up here at Buvette while sentimentally wandering through the village checking out my old haunts.\\nWhat was there once ago was a soul food restaurant called The Pink Teacup. (sigh)\\nWell gone are those days and that clientele and today what has sprung up in its place isa whole 'nother vibe.\\nNowadays it's an unpretentious post-covid little French restaurant.\\nThe menu is adorable and tres petit as are the selections but they do cover a bit of gastronomic range.\\nNow my meal which consisted of eggplant and cod and that may sound kinda basic and simple but believe me there was nothing basic or, for that matter, predictable about the tastes i experienced. The portions were not big (everything fit on 2 saucers) however the dishes themselves were quite rich so although my eyes were not satisfied, my stomach and tastebuds totally were.\\nTopped it all off with a nice cot\\u00e8 du rhone while I enjoyed an easy spring chill (which they had nothing to do with of course, but since Im setting a mood...)\\n\\nI wanted something more or different but I decided to rey something new because I liked the feel of Buvette: quaint, lots of outdoor seating and charmingly intimate. I'm really glad I choose this.\\nWhen Im looking for that special kinda romantic or intimate hang, I'll be back to Buvette. The best French brasserie in town! Every dish counts %100, we never had a bad dish once for being here for four times from LA. It's a must stop in NYC. Thank you for a great service and a delicious food. We visited Buvette on a Sunday for brunch and were greeted by a 20-minute wait, which is expected given its popularity. The interior is designed with a French theme, with menu items written in French and wine selections displayed on a mirror on the wall.\\n\\nWe ordered an Americano and a dirty chai oat milk latte, both of which were satisfying. The main dishes we tried were the Croque Madame and Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The Croque Madame consisted of Gruy\\u00e8re cheese, classic ham, and a sunny side egg, while the Eggs with Smoked Salmon were served with eggs, capers, and salmon on a slice of bread.\\n\\nAlthough portion sizes were small, the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, but it could get noisy. Overall, Buvette is a charming and casual spot for brunch with a French twist. Yo what is this place and how am I going here for the first time?? I'll be back, you can take that to the bank. The star of the show are the eggs - they're so crazy fluffy!! Top that with their cheese and SUNDRIED TOMATOES, and it's golden. I thought it was the perfect portion size (a little pricey, but worth it for sure). Additionally, get the beets because they are cooked so perfectly and topped with an amazing cream. I may opt out of getting the belgian waffle next time, since it wasn't all that special, but a nice little sweet break! I especially loved the ambiance of the spot - it is supremely brunch cute and the tables were so small it ended up being charming! Thanks Buvette for a great meal - I'll be back! :) Perfect ending to a trip to New York! Got to dine here before we caught our flight. One of our favorite spots on the trip. Luckily our hotel was walking distance. 5 star brunch! I never knew I needed steamed scrambled eggs in my life until I tried it at Buvette. I didn't know what to expect when the menu translation was \\\"steamed eggs\\\", but it was so surprisingly good!\\n\\nAlso ordered the Belgian waffle. At first I was concerned about the smaller looking portion, but turned out it was just enough for 1 person.\\n\\nOverall it was a very cozy, bustling and French-like experience with good food- excellent brunch place with good service. Let me start with saying the employees working here are not very friendly to the city workers and law enforcement officers. They treated the officer with attitude that was uncalled for!\\nI stopped here to get something for breakfast and decided on les croquet madame which essentially is an egg, ham and cheese sandwich. It was nothing special, quite salty and the flavors didn't taste good at all. The cheese on top was hard and for 18$ I found it to be overrated. Also, make sure you check for utensils since the workers never included them. I just came back from London and the London location is soo much better than the NY one. Wish it was as good as the reviews state it to be. Will not return. Delicious, delicious, delicious, what else can I say! Been here twice now and never disappointed! The food, the service, the ambiance is all wonderful. Give the staff raises, they all deserve it! Good ambience but the food falls short. The duck p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, while okay, had an excess of fat. The moules-frites were disappointingly dry and overcooked, with too little broth at the bottom. I've seen photos of Buvette for years on Instagram and finally checked it out for myself.\\n\\nI went for Sunday brunch with a friend and we arrived to a line of people outside waiting for a table. Even for prime Brunch time, the wait was very brief. We probably didn't wait for more than 15 minutes. We were lucky to eat in their covered/heated outdoor dining area.\\n\\nThe food wasn't just Insta worthy, it was just as good as it looks in photos!! I ordered the waffle sandwich which was Belgium waffle cut in half topped with an egg, Gruy\\u00e8re, bacon, and maple syrup. SO good! My friend ordered their Pain Perdue (French toast) which was outstanding and one of the best French toast I've had at a restaurant.\\nMy mocha was delightful. Definitely strong (which I love) so keep in mind if you're into super sugary coffees. This is definitely an espresso drink first, complemented by the chocolate.\\n\\nI thought the portions were on the smaller side (I could've eaten a second waffle sandwich) so you could probably order a main plus something else or an additional main to share (or just for you). Just a heads up if you come very hungry.\\n\\nLoved the food and would definitely return! It seems that this place is more known for their brunch, but my friends and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with a res. I'm not the biggest fan of French food, but every item we got here was pretty solid! The inside is very intimate & cozy, great for a date night. The waitress was attentive, and all the staff were pretty friendly. My favorite items were probably the hachee au jambon cru & brandade de morue! This used to be a go-to for breakfast, but popularity has totally overrun the previous charming and quiet atmosphere. The organization of the actual physical space that staff have to cartwheel through is not equipped to handle lines out the door. Now, breakfasts even on a weekday are so hectic, with staff truly trying to work as fast as they can in an open, cramped bar line, that it is near impossible to relax as a customer. Simple coffees will often come out after you are done eating your entire breakfast because the coffee bar is so backed up. The food itself remains delicious and noteworthy but not at the expense of feeling stressed after settling the bill. Best bet is to come right at open, or snag a table at the end of the night. I've walked past this place many times and scared away when I've seen the long lines. Since they don't take reservations, it's hard to tell how long the wait may be. Well, today I decided to give it a chance and get in line! At 10:45 on a Sunday morning, they were pretty full, but since I was dining solo I got in a bit quicker. I maybe waited 30-40 min max? Joshua did a great job at keeping the line organized and walking down to ask how many people in each party. That way if a table opens up that fits your party size, you'll get seated regardless of how long you may be waiting in line. This make the process more efficient and keeps everyone moving along. I was amazed at how quick and organized this was!\\n\\nI finally got seated outside at the cutest red table right against the window. These are meant to be seats for solo diners. If I wanted to sit inside, the wait would have been even longer. Annie was my server and she is the absolute BEST! I was so impressed that despite how crazy busy they were she was patient, made recommendations, checked on me frequently, and always gave service with a smile (she wore a mask, but I could sense the smiling eyes). Often restaurants sort of ignore solo diners and focus on large parties since they'll spend more. At Buvette, I was so happy with the service I wanted to recognize Annie and tell the manager about it. Sadly, he wasn't in today but I hope he reads this! Annie is an absolute gem and made my experience at Buvette memorable.\\n\\nThe almond croissants are a must! So good! Not overly sweet, but just right. I paired it with a cappuccino that was perfectly paired with my croissant. One shot of espresso in the drink we just what I needed to get moving today. Next time hope to try the cafe miel (2 shots of espresso)! There is bar seating and other tables inside and a restroom is available. All of the staff looked hard working and very quick with bringing out orders, taking care of delivery pickups, and clearing dishes. Overall, I'm glad I waited in line today. I went here for a girls night dinner. Our reservation was at 5:45 PM. I arrived a bit early so I was offered a seat at the bar while I waited for the rest of my party.\\n\\nI was immediately greeted by a bartender and my drink order was taken. I got the Bees Knees, which was delightful. The cocktail menu is extensive with a variety of options.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is adorable and feels like your are in a bistro in Paris. Once the rest of my party arrived we were taken to our table. The tables are a bit close together, but that wasn't a major issue.\\n\\nOur server was polite and prompt. He made sure to check-in on us every time our glasses were empty,\\n\\nWe started with the Escargot. The Escargot was delicious and had about 6 pieces. We then got the steamed mussels with curry and fries. The sauce that came with the mussels was absolutely phenomenal. We asked for extra bread so we could dip it in the sauce, and the waiter bought some over.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple bottles of wine to drink at the table. We were at the table for about 2.5-3 hours, and we never felt rushed. The waiter never pressured us to ask to close out, and allowed us to stay at the table and continue ordering wine.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. Reservations are hard to get, so if you can't get a reservation I would recommend walking in early, before 6PM. I loved this place, great vibe, friendly staff and good food. You dont need to make a reservation. I love this restaurant is very charming and the food is good. Beautiful space small but comfortable enough. The service is a little impersonal and abrupt. I came in for lunch as I usually do- and a tip to the restaurant staff would be solo diner doesn't want to sit at a crowded bar when you have a restaurant full small tables. That was a little offputting to be given a space at the bar. I said no and told them I wanted to sit in a little back patio which I did, it was only one other couple out there. I think it was about 3 PM. But I always enjoy the atmosphere and I love the interior, and the food. Not the best sitting but the food they serve is out of this world. No wonder why they have a huge line. Make sure to go there during a weekday -- might be less busier. France is a great seafood city. I loved food from family.\\nThanks for the tip.\\nThank you, Dr. Jacqueline Sacco MD PhD Superrr cute French cafe. We just stopped for some wine and coffee and got temped by the apple tarte and goat cheese recommended by our kind waiter. The apple tarte was pretty unusual, it wasn't too sweet at all, and it was more like a quince-paste like texture rather than cooked sliced apples. The goat cheese was served with candied cherries and I fell in love even though I normally dislike cherries especially Mari chino cherries. Ask the waiter for bread, they drizzle delicious EVOO on it and it was divineee. I could have just had cheese bread and pie for a whole meal. My experience at Buvette was uncomfortable . The moment my friends and I entered the restaurant we noticed the vibe was off. We were seated at the back of the restaurant near the service/washer, far away from the main section restaurant, where only the service workers were. We were the only people of color (Asians) and we were separated from the rest of the restaurant. After we finished eating and paid for our meal, a Black family of 4 walked in and were seated at the only long table at the back adjacent to the table we were sat. As walked through the length of the restaurant to leave, we noticed more than enough unoccupied tables (the place was practically empty) the family of 4 could have been sat. As my friends and I walked out the restaurant, we turned back at the restaurant to see the family of four walking out of the restaurant. This is a great brunch I had the bacon egg with cheese on a waffle with syrup what a combo steamed eggs on toast made in a espresso steamer and steak tartar also fantastic almond croissant Oh, this place is just all around lovely. I'd love to start off by mentioning how the staff is always so kind and attentive. It really means so much to be treated sweetly especially at a restaurant with delicious food! We really enjoy our visits here and everything we order. We've had both dinner and brunch here and the food is just *chefs kiss*!\\n\\nI'll have to add a photo of the food next time. I didn't capture the brunch we had unfortunately. I ordered the prosciutto and eggs and it was wonderful! So cool that they steam their eggs. Makes them a perfect fluffy texture. My lady ordered salmon and eggs and it was just as good. Especially with capers.\\n\\nSometimes there's a wait. We've had to wait for tables before and trust me, it's worth the wait! Expect weekends to be busy (how could you not), so definitely come with time to spare!\\n\\nIt's truly a restaurant in art form. Very French, too. You'll forget you're in America! Just so lovely. I'll always look forward to my visits at Buvette. 7 years since I've been to Buvette!\\n\\nI arrived around 11:45am on a summer Friday and my mom and sister weren't there yet. I asked the host if there was a wait and if I should put my name down. He said there wasn't really a list, but to wait in line by the side, and he'll seat me when they have an available table.\\n\\nAround 12:10pm, my mom showed up and he seated us inside while we waited for my sister. I really appreciated that he seated us without the full party. Probably because he felt so bad that I was waiting alone for so long in the heat.\\n\\nStaff inside were friendly and efficient. No one rushed us out, even when we finished our food and were just chatting. I had the Croque Monsieur, mom had the prosciutto and scrambled eggs, and sister had the waffle sandwich. We also split a Belgian waffle.\\n\\nAll the food was really good, but I do think the portions are a bit on the small side. One dish is good to be satisfied for all of us, but I can see it not being enough for some.\\n\\nHonestly, a great solid place to have breakfast or brunch if you're in the West Village. It's close to tons of boutique shopping and also Magnolia's if you're looking for a post-brunch cupcake. Brunch\\n: the croque madame!\\n: it was super crowded so the wait was a bit long\\nServicio: slow\\nDeco: nice, french style\\nTip: come for a nice brunch!\\n\\nBrunch\\n: el croque madame!\\n: estaba super lleno asi que la espera era un poco larga\\nService: lento\\nDeco: lindo, estilo franc\\u00e9s\\nTip: vengan por un rico brunch! Egg dishes are incredible, however a bit overpriced (especially the carrot side dish, which was excellent). Service was not very friendly, especially for a non-busy Friday morning. Great location in the west village. Great food and vibe, as always. Service was quick. The line moved pretty quickly for Saturday brunch. The hostess was super friendly and accommodating. All the dishes were amazing. Continue to be my go-to brunch spot in the west village. Cute and very small establishment. Very helpful when sitting you and taking your order. After that, you have to ask for everything else, more water, sugar and even your check. At least it's small enough to grab waiter's attention.\\n\\nCroissants are okay, not flaky more chewy. The raspberry jam it very good.\\n\\nJambon Cru was very tasty if you like steamed eggs and prosciutto. Plenty of portion of steam egg given to you which is very nice. Not a heavy meal to have. Feels very light. Yes- worth the wait. I've been here a few times now and the breakfast is out of this world. While it is on the pricier side, it's worth it if you love breakfast and want a little taste of France.\\n\\nYou cannot make a reservation for breakfast. It is first come, first serve and you wait in line outside until a table for your party size is available (vs giving your number and coming back when table is ready). We went on a Saturday around 10:30 and it was about 20 minutes for the wait. The line usually wraps around corner but it goes relatively quickly, so don't be put off.\\n\\nWe both ordered the jambon cru, americano, and split a scone. And the scone was so delicious that I returned 3 days later for another. The coffee is also the perfect strength, and the scone is flaky on the outside but soft and buttery on the inside served with orange marmalade and homemade creamy butter. Cute place! Waited about 20 minutes for brunch and ordered the Jambon Cru ($17) and a Cappuccino ($6.50). The eggs on the Jambon Cru were DIVINE. SO GOOD. they came out perfectly fluffy and the prosciutto complimented the eggs very well.\\n\\nCons - the portions were pretty small and the atmosphere was quite cramped :o The other night, I was ruthlessly sabotaging my circadian rhythm by indulging in revenge sleep procrastination. This is otherwise known as mindlessly scrolling down on TikTok in bed for at least an hour. But then my algorithm showed me a TikTok about Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet eating at Buvette.\\n\\nAnd hey. If this place is good enough for Timmy (and me), it's good enough for you.\\n\\nIn some ways, Buvette in the West Village feels more stereotypically French than the Buvette in the 9th arrondissement of Paris--I was lucky enough to visit the original Paris location before visiting the New York location. The location on this side of the pond romanticizes the American idea of Paris, so it's safe to say that the atmosphere at Buvette is one of the top reasons to come here.\\n\\nThe other one? The variations of croques on the menu--yes, even vegetarians will be happy. My trips to Paris are honestly one of the few times that I \\\"forget\\\" that I don't eat red meat because I lose all self-restraint after seeing croque monsieurs on every single caf\\u00e9 menu. Luckily, Buvette makes it easy for me to not hate myself later with the croque forestier: a rich sandwich with roasted mushrooms and gruy\\u00e8re.\\n\\nDon't forget to cop a complimentary Buvette matchbook on your way out to really feel like you're in Paris. I should start by saying that I have had many lovely meals here. Unfortunately, the last one shifted my feelings toward this establishment. The first thing I noticed, seated outside with a colleague, was that there were rats crawling in and out of the outdoor seating area. When I mentioned this to a staff member, they laughed and walked away. Then, an item my guest ordered was not priced as represented and the server was unwilling to adjust this. Finally, before we even signed our check, our server turned off all the heat lamps, and thus the light, outside. We were literally sitting in the cold and dark and my guest had not finished their drink, nor had we completed our conversation, when this happened. It all seemed rude and inappropriate. I contacted the offices of this restaurant to share this feedback and offer them an opportunity to respond but no one did. I came for brunch with a friend and it was packed! We opted to sit outside and ordered the salmon eggs dish and a juice.\\n\\nThere eggs came out in literally two minutes so we are sure they already have them ready to serve - honestly, they were just ok. I had the vegetable + fruit juice and it was too sweet even for a sweet tooth like me. My friend liked her orange juice though.\\n\\nThe spot was cute but food not great so I don't think I'll be back. Just wanted to give a huge shout-out to the staff here who were so kind after an accident at our table - it's quite cramped inside and due to the carelessness of another diner, one of the drinks at our table got knocked over and spilled all over my friend, including the glass being shattered on her. Although this was no fault of Buvette, the staff were so sweet and accommodating, and truly went above and beyond to make up for the experience. Can't thank them enough for that even when it wasn't necessary.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, the food and coffee are delicious. Highly recommend the Cafe Miel and the almond croissants. The scrambled eggs are also perfection. Merci beaucoup! line looks long but moved much faster than expected- wait for 2 at 11:40 am saturday was about 15-20 min!\\n\\n\\nheard about this renowned brunch spot from many koreans on youtube / blogs, so had to try it! i'm a huge brunch lover so i had high expectations.\\n\\nfirst off, i'd go just to try the unique way the eggs were prepared: steamed, not fried! it tastes like steamed egg but creamier and light. the proscuitto jambon egg was tasty but the toast was way too hard so it was difficult to cut & share. the croque al madame was really good, had some gravy like savory taste embedded which was very rich. we sat at the bar and got mimosas as well which were amazing! the bartender was very courteous and friendly, never losing his cool (even when someone shattered a glass behind him) and with a smile on his face. we felt so welcome there and it was just the right noise level to still be able to be engaged in conversation. It always comes down to the booze.\\nJust don't do it.\\nMy simple \\\"waffle sandwich\\\" was ok...and acceptable at $17\\nbut add in a mimosa and one more drink... and I was at $60+\\nafter all is said and done.\\nI can do better at home.\\nIt's popular. It's kind of a place to be seen.\\nI came during the week, and would NEVER wait for the privilege but you gotta choose for yourself.\\nMaybe I'll give them a shot at dinner... but breakfast/brunch is just over rated. Tiny French cafe in the west village that offers French staples. The space is tight but cozy, truly resembles a cafe in Paris. Portions are small, but the food is worth it. All of the options in the L\\u00e9gumes (vegetable) section are divine. The tartines are also a must have. They have a good wine menu and several cocktail options. Don't leave this place without getting the Buvette Manhattan Saturday brunch. There was a line, but since we were a party of two we did not have to wait long. The scone was delicious. I would go back just for that. Eggs ch\\u00e8vre was such a great balance between the soft eggs, goat cheese, and rich sun dried tomatoes. It was cozy and warm inside. Highly recommend! Arrived at 8pm and put a reservation down for 3 since all of the pre-made reservations from Resy were booked for that day. I was told it was a one hour wait and there was no space at the bar. Roughly 45 minutes later I got a text that the table was ready and to text back so that the table could be held for 10 minutes. We had a group of three. The table options were low to the ground benches by the door or a two top table by the bar with a stool added to fit a third. The spacing was comical, but the servers were present and the food was amazing. We started off with the cheese platter and a round of Kir drinks. I ordered the Kir Breton which was nicely presented with an orange peel. It was more bubbly than I had expected and sweeter than the Kir Royal. It was a perfect aperitif to have with the buttery, choux gougers and cheese plate. Two of the cheeses were from upstate NY, a third was from Vermont, and the last was from Massachusetts. The Finger-lakes Gold and Calderwood were my favorite. The platter was on the sweet side and came with an apricot pur\\u00e9e, cherries, figs, and honey. A waiter came by with extra grilled and oil lathered bread to spread the cheeses on. The next round was the escargot served in shells in an herbed butter sauce. The 6 portion was perfect for the three of us to split. The shells were beautifully cleaned and gleamed in the lighting. Tongs were not provided so they were a little hot to the touch, but the tiny forks made it easy to pop out the small bite. My trick was to flip it on top of the bread provided to soak up all the flavorful butter. My friends split a bowl of the bouillabaisse. It was served with two more pieces of toasts slathered in a tomato hollandaise sauce. The broth was rather translucent. We surmised that this was a bit of a deconstructed soup that should have been mixed more and enjoyed by directly dunking the bread in. Two clams, two muscles, and shrimp were served in the dish. It was perfect for two. We ordered a bottle of Les Dos D'chat Jura wine. Jura wines are exciting for me in their distinctness. This one held a strong jasmine scent on the nose and pallet. We paired that with the steak tartar and the au gratin potatoes. The steak was finely diced and a large portion by this point in our meal. The potatoes in cream were so rich and I think this was my favorite dish. We finished the meal by sharing a beautiful chocolate mousse. This is dense and rich. It's too much for one person, but it's great to share or even take home. I might return at a quieter time just for the mousse. Our meal lasted close to three hours and we were not rushed. In fact, we had waiters checking on us frequently and refilling our waters as we needed it. When a busser was not certain which wine to suggest, a chef or sommelier was called to the table to help assist. The host who took our reservation was friendly and French. It was a nice touch to the atmosphere and the staff was pretty international and highly skilled. The entire meal came out to $368 with the tip included. It is a splurge, but for French style dining the price was reasonable for the amount of food and $50 bottle of wine we ordered. An evening at Buvette appeals to those who are fit and fashionable and those used to a higher quality of dining, but willing to put up with limited space. I suspect there may be quiet afternoons and brunches with slightly more space, but with as welcome of an atmosphere to sit, stay, and enjoy a well prepared meal. Such a great meal!\\nWent here for breakfast as a group of three. One of our friends got there at 9 and got on line. I got there at 915 and they seated us right away as we were in front of the line.\\nNote- they don't take reservations and you are seated by standing on a line along the brick wall next to the restaurant.\\nI would never attempt to stand on this line past 10am unless that doesn't stress you out. They get very crowded but the line does move fast.\\nThe inside is tiny but their outdoor set up is great!! And they have a back little garden/ patio as well.\\nThe service and staff was excellent.\\nI love that even though they are busy, they are not rushing you out of there (that's the French in them).\\nWe got:\\n- ginger tea\\n- cappuccino\\n- croque forestier\\n- Ch\\u00e8vre eggs\\n\\nEverything was excellent. The eggs were cooked so perfectly!! The croque was so flavorful.\\nWe also ordered a croissant but they forgot to bring it and we reminded them at the end if we can get it to go and they gave it for free as an apology for not bringing it out in the beginning. So nice!\\n\\nWould love to come back here for dinner and even for breakfast again to try pretty much every item on their menu.\\nThe line lives up to the hype. Buvette is a lovely little restaurant in the West Village, and we were amazingly able to get a reservation at a decent hour on a Sunday night. It may be easier to get a table given that they have a ton of outdoor seating now.\\n\\nWe started with the proscuitto, cheese and honey on bread which was relatively small but a perfect bit to begin our meal. For my main, I ordered the Gorgonzola burger on focaccia with fries. The burger was compact but very hearty. We shared the apple tarte tatin for dessert.\\n\\nA lovely spot for dinner! Nice atmosphere, was on top 10 of places to eat in nyc, won't go back , it was fine , but nothing to recommend An adorable brunch place! The food was delicious and the service was great. Also thoroughly enjoyed the coffee. Came here after seeing a YouTube video calling it the Best Brunch in NYC. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the portion sizes; however, the fluffiness of the scrambled eggs on the perfectly toasted bread definitely made up for it. The ham and salmon were not bad. The capers though... wow they were amazing! A well made & enjoyable meal-- nothing mind blowing, but trusty and reliable.\\n\\nAlthough I would not say it was the best brunch I ever had, the general vibe and feel of the cafe were very comfortable. The service was also decent given the extreme heat wave in NYC and the random thunderstorm that hit in the middle of our meal. Can you think of a better place to feel like you are in Paris? This is my favorite spot to enjoy a delicious breakfast. The cafe latte and the croque madame are my favorite combination. But everything is perfect. Why four stars? The lines! There is always a line! With this being our first time in Manhattan, we wanted a nice breakfast that had great reviews and that's how I stumbled across Buvette. The restaurant serves breakfast, brunch and dinner until 2am. Buvette offers indoor and outdoor seating but for indoor seating they do require proof of Covid vaccine. We didn't bring ours so outside it was. Outdoor sitting is quiet, quaint and peaceful. We came for the breakfast and it didn't disappoint. We all got the the Waffle sandwiches which were one of the best we've ever had. The service here is great but for the price, the portions are small.\\n\\nNonetheless, the food speaks for itself and later we may go for dinner but there are so many restaurants to visit and I'll write a review if we do. I would definitely recommend Buvette to anyone who wants a delicious breakfast or brunch in a quiet setting and not being rushed. I would definitely make this one of my go to spots if I lived here. Great job Buvette Had the waffle sandwich, steak tartare, salmon eggs, and avocado toast. I decided to return to this place after many years.\\n\\nThey are known for their eggs, which are good. I got the bread with the eggs and prosciutto with the shaved parm. This is probably the most popular dish. However it's not something that I would go out of my way for.\\n\\nThe bread was too well done, I had trouble slicing the bread even with the butter knife that they provide.\\n\\nHowever the ambience and area makes for a good brunch.\\n\\nOverall average food\\n\\n3 stars - Average The La vie En Rose cocktail was delightful. We had the mussels, pasta, and filet mignon. Everything was cooked to perfection and served beautifully plated.\\nWe were seated in the loft, which gave us a more intimate dining experience. The noise level was quite low and conversation flowed as easily as the wine. The server was knowledgeable and attentive.\\nHighly recommend. Got brunch with a friend here on a Sunday morning. There was a line outside when we arrived, but since we were a party of two, we only waited 10-15 minutes before getting seated. I would recommend going as a party of 2 since most of the patio and street seating are tables for 2.\\n\\nI ordered the waffle sandwich, my friend got the jambon cru, and we shared an almond croissant. The almond croissant (it's actually 2 small croissants) was delicious and the perfect level of sweetness. Both of us thought our food was good and really enjoyed it, but neither of us were completely blown away. I would come back to try other pastries here (eyeing the scone) The food was ok and I wasn't overly impressed with anything. I wonder if people are more enamored with the idea of a French brunch than the taste of the food? I was definitely surprised at the line to get in. Just standing there I was thinking there is no one on this line from NY. I realize that is NY nowadays, but it did feel touristy in its own right. The waitress commented she didn't know why people would wait on line to come in, lol. Again food was food was nothing to write home about and you will be squeezed in because it's tiny. Two stars for the waitress. She was about the only thing real in our French experience. Personally, the best way to brunch is like the French and Buvette does a great job taking you to that sweet (& buttery) spot.\\n\\nWhat all I ordered?\\n\\nStarted off our meal (2 people) with:\\n- Americano: (4/5) black and potent just the way I love it\\n- Cappuccino: a nice, milky hug of caffeine. (4/5) if you like your coffee milky, (3/5) if you like bold and strong coffee.\\n- Almond Croissant: (4.5/5) mini buttery and subtly sweet pastry that comes in a pair so perfect for us to share.\\n\\nFor our mains, we shared a\\nCroque Monsieur: (4/5) came as two massive heaps of the halves of the butter-drenched toast filled with ham and gruyere and coated with more cheese because why not. The pickles on the side add a nice pop of green and balance to the almost sedating plate of food.\\nSaumon Fume: (5/5) buttery and silky smooth steamed eggs prepared in a jar attached to the same espresso machine that probably prepared my coffee. The creme fraiche adds a coolness and freshness to the dish that I didn't know I desired until the first, glorious bite. Only wish they weren't out of cornichons that day so I could get that pop of green too (in the pictures I copped a pickle from the other order for the aesthetic appeal I wanted)\\n\\nAlong the way ordered another cup of\\n- Americano: loved it but the serving size of one cup is a little underwhelming hence had to do a round 2\\n- Bottle of freshly squeezed Orange Juice: (5/5) since our mains were very savory and rich a bottle of freshly-squeezed OJ with pulp was just the right kind of sweetness and mild acidity to keep us hydrated and refreshed in the make-believe Parisienne cafe-vibe created which I absolutely loved.\\n\\nTo end, although we were stuffed, to continue surfing the food high wave, we got the Mousse au Chocolat (5/5). It appears in front of you as a blob of rich chocolate mousse topped with a blob of light, airy unsweetened whipped cream. The mousse itself is decadent, with almost a flourless cake or chilled buttercream frosting like texture that is both rich in probably a higher percentage chocolate and deep in flavor. The unsweetened whipped cream does the dish justice by cutting that deep flavor keep you going in for seconds and thirds until you've clean-swiped the plate.\\n\\nBuvette is the place to go if you're looking for an extremely indulgent French Brunch in a place that teleports you to a Parisienne cafe with its vibe. Probably the best French spot in town. (Rosalie in Vegas is my top fave in the world by far)\\n\\nWould certainly return to try their Plain Croissant, Pain Perdu, Coq au Vin and many more but probably after I've given my tummy some rest from the (over)indulgence!\\n\\nHighly recommend Excellent ambiance and service by Nobel and a perfect amount of breakfast. We had a great birthday brunch there for me-10:30am on a Wednesday. Sat right down (outside). Enjoyed a croque madam, the jambon gru, two cappuccinos, chocolate croissants, and the most wonderful OJ.\\n\\nService was friendly! Croque was outstanding. There was a line to wait to get seated which is okay! Once we we were seated the waiter took our drink order. The orange juice was $10 and was very delicious. I ordered two of them so had $20 worth of fresh squeezed orange juice just myself.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 glasses of orange juice, a Belgium waffle, and a waffle sandwich and an almond croissant. We waited for about 30 minutes to order our food, and so our waiter paid for our almond croissant. Our bill ended up being around $70.\\n\\nThe food was average! Outdoor seating was cute. ambiance is extremely cute. menus are adorable, too. i get the hype.\\n\\nfood was pretty good but not great. there were some olive pits left behind in my stew which was not ideal. coq au vin was salty. servings are on the smaller side.\\n\\nbut overall, a very pleasant experience! lol the portions are TINYYYYY. am I a pigeon??? I'm crying. I'm literally still hungry. I love this quaint little place. This French bistro with James Beard Award winning chefs stole my heart. Their Mussels in Curry Broth was one of the best things I ever ate! It's a must-try. My favorite brunch spot. The best Croque Monsieur and Cappuccino in town. Perfect for any type of dining. Staff is the best! This place was one of the list I wanted to try it out. It was raining but there was like 20 people waiting. I usually do not wait in line for a restaurant but since they don't take reservations, everyone has to wait in line.\\n\\nI had cappuccino and waffle sandwich. It was good but does it worth the wait? I don't know. To me it was just some waffles. Staff was nice but I don't think I will come back again. Upgrading my review to 5 stars because their breakfast/brunch fare exceeds that of dinner.\\n\\nI ordered the jambon cru (les \\u0153ufs vapeurs). The eggs were extremely fluffy but rich, cooked on low heat, and the saltiness of the prosciutto paired well with the rest of the dish. I liked how crunchy the bread was as well, as it opposed the soft texture of the eggs.\\n\\nIs it worth $17? That's up to you to decide, but it was a nice experience that left me content. Well I went this cafe on Saturday lunch time. Of course there was a line and waited about 30 mins. we chose indoor seats and it was crazy noisy. I babrely could listen to my friends and seats are too tight so that I needed to bend my shoulder a bit during my meal.\\nWe ordered\\n\\nCoffee\\nOrange juice\\nBelgian waffle\\nSaumon fume\\n\\nJuice was freah and perfect. Other than that, rest of them all were pretty common and just mediocre except for the expensive price. I have never written a review before, but this restaurant is awful. Came here for brunch with my partner, ordered an iced americano ($5.50, will be important later on) and a couple other dishes. When I ordered the americano, I made sure to say with ice. The waitress nodded and then left.The first issue was that we were sat at the bar and my stool was broken and wobbly. I noticed a couple wait staff notice the issue however, they ignored it. Our food came out and the dishes were small and pricey, but decent (roughly $17 per dish). Judging by the speed that they were delivering food, and the fact that they can not make modifications to any dish, leads me to assume the food is just reheated lol but this is just a guess. Our experience was fine but not great until this point. After we were done eating the bill came out and on the bill was a new yorker and an americano, they had added an extra drink (new yorker $8) to the bill which we did not have. They quickly seemed to fix the issue however, once again, instead of billing us for ONLY an iced americano, they then charged us for an $8.00 new yorker. I then asked the waitress to change it to the $5.50 americano, as that was what I had ordered. The waitress then told us that I had actually had a new yorker. Obviously, the two drinks look similar, so I did not know that I had consumed a new yorker. I explained very patiently that I had ordered an americano with ice, and not a new yorker nor did I know it was a new yorker when consuming the beverage. I then respecetfully asked her why she put in an order for a new yorker when I did not ask for that, OR tell me that they do not serve iced americanos to begin with when I ordered it. The waitress, irritated at this point, with a degrading tone, gave a bullshit answer saying that they can not make iced americanos. I then asked, how did they make an iced new yorker but not an iced americano? She ignored me and cut me off and just put the bill in my face, glaring at me. This was the dirty blonde waitress with freckles and the only female wait staff on Thursday brunch time. I should have called the manager over but I was with my partner celebrating valentine's and didn't want to make a scene. I am okay with 50 cent ice charges... but wow this waitress absolutely ruined our experience. Her attitude was completely degrading, and she just wanted to get us out of our seats. The fact that the standard tip at this establishment is 30% just shows how entitled these people are and how they do not care about creating a hospitable or enjoyable experience. Even though it wasn't a crazy amount of money, I felt scammed. Do not visit this place, I genuinely hope this establishment fails and goes under, as I'm sure it's not the waitresses' sole fault but one of the owner to persist on paying the more expensive price. Utter disgrace. Beautiful. Aestheticly pleasing. Flavors were mind blowing. Service was perfect. A little pricey but it's worth what you actually get. We are going a second time the day we go home. A couple of my friends & I visited Buvette on a Saturday around 2PM. The line was long, but it did move pretty quickly!\\n\\nWe were seated inside & ordered from the brunch menu. We tried the fresh squeezed orange juice (pricey, but worth it!), belgian waffle, croque madame, waffle sandwich, & saumon fum\\u00e9. To our surprise, all of our food came out rather fast -- it was definitely tasty, but didn't quite blow us out of the water.\\n\\nThe best part about Buvette is definitely the ambiance & service. We'll be back again to reevaluate with some pastries & charcuterie! Food 5/5\\nSecond time back, and I got the jambon crue. Fluffy and delightful eggs, paired with fresh crunchy bread. Took my breath away, and I immediately inhaled the entire dish. I also ordered the espresso martini and WOW, can I just say WOW. I got the vodka one, which was a lot lighter than the tequila one my friend ordered. The intense coffee bean flavor was insane, paired so well with our mains.\\n\\nService 4/5\\nA little slow, but nothing to be unhappy about\\n\\nInterior 5/5\\nThe first time, we only sat outside so I never got a chance to peak inside. Although we sat under their cutest outdoor area with fairy lights and all, I peeked inside. It felt like as if I was transported to Europe, with the dim lighting and soft music playing. The dark wood really does it all. The bathrooms were downstairs and they had literal baskets of oranges and apples, i love it. Mainly dropping by to shout out Michael M who took care of us last night at Buvette. Incredibly warm and kind, and suggested the fantastic pairing of desserts and dessert wine that concluded our night perfectly. The mousse au chocolat is a must have! A beautiful space - can't wait to be back soon. My wife and I wanted to do something special for our anniversary so we came here. We ate outside, it was a bit chilly but they turned on the heater for us. The food was awesome. Try the escargot, tepanade, and mussells. We'll be sure to come back again. Cozy French spot with a small breakfast, lunch, & dinner menu of small-plates.\\n\\nIt was extremely popular when I went for Sunday brunch (there was a line down the block), but since I came in alone I got in right away. Although I could have sat at the bar, I opted to sit at this awesome table for 1 person they had that was right next to the window (prime people watching seat).\\n\\nI got a honey latte, an almond croissant, and a toast dish that was covered in scrambled eggs, lox, and creme fresh. I wasn't too big of a fan of any of it, but I will say that all of the ingredients were very fresh.\\n\\nThey also don't have too many traditional breakfast options to choose from.\\n\\nOnly have 2 restrooms, which was a little bit of a problem since the place was popping. Too make it worse, the bathrooms are downstairs and there is not a lot of space for people to wait\\n\\nWaitress was very friendly\\n\\nOpen untill 2 AM\\n\\n5.5 The service was great. Had Americano and a scone. Great neighborhood place to enjoy some wonderful items. The lunch menu looks good so that will be next time A bit grossed out, and I hope we don't get sick.\\n\\nWe were really looking forward to eating here because of a friend's recommendation. The food itself was not bad, but we sat under an air conditioning vent that dripped water onto our food. They were coming by to wipe the vent periodically, and we initially gave them the benefit of the doubt it wouldn't drip into the food, but once they took the plates away it was definitely dripping onto the table where the plates were. We asked the waitress who assured us the vents are clean, and that this tends to happen on humid days. I didn't find that reassuring. It's been only an hour since we left and I hope we don't get sick. \\u2060\\nI saw so many great things about this restaurant, their Jambon Cru (steamed eggs, prosciutto w/ shaved parmesan) especially. And I was disappointed. I knew the eggs would not be a hard scramble but it was SUPER wet. I hated the texture and it had absolutely no taste. Had to put salt and pepper, I even asked for ketchup and the waiter turned his nose up at me \\\"we don't have ketchup here\\\" \\u2060\\n\\u2060\\nThe french toast was fresh and my other friend thought his avocado toast was just alright. The latte was okay. I definitely wasn't in love. \\u2060\\n\\u2060\\nWill I go back here? No\\u2060\\nDo I think you should try it? My personal opinion... Eh don't bother. There are so many other great restaurants where the food is amazing!\\u2060\\n\\u2060\\n\\u2060 The wait wasn't bad for an outside or bar seat, however we chose to wait for an inside table which took around 50 mins. I arrived at 11am on a Saturday and there was already a line out the door. Once seated, our waiter was with us immediately. The star of the show in my opinion was the almond croissant. So soft and sweet, it was perfect. The egg with salmon looks appetizing but it fell short for me, there was really nothing special about it aside from the eggs being very fluffy (which I enjoyed). The fresh squeezed juice was delicious. It's very small inside and you will be sitting right next to someone, however that is quite common in New York. I would come back for the pastries. The most adorable brunch spot with great food! The Croq Forestier was like a hug for your stomach and the Lemonice was fantastic! My fianc\\u00e9 also loved his saumon fume which was a smoked salmon with steamed eggs which was also delicious! There's a cute garden in the back too - highly recommend this place I only had their croissant and their steamed eggs (with goat cheese & sun dried tomatoes) and it was SOOO GOOD. Both are SO SOFT. HIGHLY recommend any of their steamed egg plates.\\n\\nI also just wanna say I loved the plating of the steamed eggs!!! It is eggs over toast and they leave just enough at the ends of the toast for you to pick up with your hand.\\n\\nVibes here are so cute! Service was great!\\n\\nIt is quite a popular brunch spot though. It opened at 8am, and I got there at 8:20am and there was already a line. This was my first time going to Buvette and had seen multiple people on my social media raving about it so I had to try it while I was in NYC. When we arrived there was a long line of people waiting. You don't write your name down anywhere, the waitress just comes down the line picking out groups of people based on what tables are availability. We waited about 15 mins only because they have plenty of outdoor seating and it was only 2 of us so there are always 2 people tables available.\\n\\nWe ordered the croque monsieur, the waffle sandwich, two fresh lemonades, a hot latte and an iced coffee. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I feel like the croque monsieur had lot of cheese for my liking but that's just a personal preference. I definitely would like to try the croque madame in the future. The waiters were attentive and still following covid regulations as they ask the customers to please have their masks on when they approach the table and/or before getting your food. It's rare to have good food, atmosphere and service in one spot. This place exceeds my expectations each time I'm here. The croque forestier with mushrooms and Gruy\\u00e8re cheese is incredible (get it with the fried egg). The Belgian waffle is fresh and with the berries and cr\\u00e8me fraiche, it's the perfect dessert to your breakfast. Waited for 30mins to be seated on Saturday noon, maybe our expectation was too high, it turned out food was pretty small portion & extremely overrated compared with price. Also the Staffs were not that friendly and it seemed they don't know what they are doing. our server came to us & asked how's everything when we only had glasses of water and we didn't even order yet. Me and my friend literally said wtf & cracked up. Then Later same person came and he rushed to proceed our payment even without showing us how much total. It's not worth it Came here for a late lunch, at 4:30 they were serving dinner menu. I got croque ham and cheese which was very good and a decade americano coffee. Coffee I highly recommend as well. My friend got the ratatouille which she also seemed to enjoy. I'm interested to try out more of the menu, they have a good selection of wines and cocktails. Would also love to try their brunch menu! Will def be back Even for New York this place is tiny. The worlds smallest tables and chairs are available here so just keep that in mind if you or anyone in the party has mobility issues. The bathroom is down a very narrow flight of stairs as well. But the service was excellent and the breakfast items and pastries are very good. Great place to start and then you can just walk around the neighborhood. Absolutely incredible brunch with the bestie on a Sunday morning in the summer. Delicious coffee to start. Shared scones and chocolate croissants. Had the steamed eggs with smoked salmon, she had the croque madame. Both very happy customers and will be back! I can't visit the West Village without enjoying the marvelous food at Buvette. The Avocado Toast is perfection and the Brioche is my favorite, hands down. It's perfectly Parisian in a tightly-packed NYC package. I hope to enjoy a visit for dinner soon, but I can't seem to wait that long in the day so far. Enjoy. Went here for brunch with a friend and loved every moment of it. It was busy and bustling even on a rainy Wednesday at 2PM. Any spot the locals love is a place worth going to.\\nThe layout is dense and tables are packed on top of each other, making it difficult to get in and out of your seats if the restaurant has a full house, but that was the only downside of the restaurant.\\n\\nSuper friendly and attentive staff. The menu was concise with entrees ~$17-20. Teas/lattes = $7 and juice ~$11. I had the saumon fume (smoked salmon with eggs and cr\\u00e8me fraiche on toast) and loved it! A breakfast for 2 came out to $80.\\nOverall, a sweet and date I say romantic brunch outing! My friend and I ordered dinner at the bar, we're sat directly where the servers get their drinks but not a big deal as it was 8pm on a Friday. We we're hungry, so se ordered the coq au vin, which was delicious yet small, as well as the saucisson and two cheeses. We also clearly ordered the cheapest red wine on the menu after inquiring about the price of the house wine. And while we served this wine, the server attempted to charge us for $22/glass wine instead. When we called him out on his error, he didn't fight it - which leads me to believe that this deceiving practice is consistent behavior to increase sales and tips. I've attempted to resolve this directly with the restaurant but they've yet to respond. Walking in Greenwich village, I stumbled upon this little gem. I was not disappointed. Great food and service with a good wine selection. This place is so charming and fun. My husband and I got lucky here one evening and managed to snag a seat right outside for some wine and cheese. Prime people watching spot! The wine is incredible, the vibes immaculate, the cheese divine. There's not a ton of vegetarian meal options, which is to be expected since it's French, but for a light snack and some wine, it is perfection. Overpriced French food in West Village. My party of 4 arrived at 10:30 am on a Saturday morning and were seated within 10 minutes but did stand in the line that was quickly forming. A carafe of orange juice was $11, a croque madame sandwich (which was basically an open-faced egg sandwich with ham) was $17 and a black coffee was $5. Our waiter was efficient but a little stand-off-ish. What bugged me the most was after we paid he specifically said, \\\"Take all the time you need, even though I'm settling the check now stay as long as you want and I'll refill your water.\\\" but 5 minutes later a bus boy or someone grumbled at us, \\\"You guys have to leave now, there are people waiting,\\\" which I agree, there are people waiting but then don't tell me I can take all the time I need if you don't really mean it. Employees need to be on the same page and I also don't like being snapped at by a stranger, thank you very much. Mediocre food in a cramped space with unfriendly staff, just another day in NYC I guess. Looking for a place to get a delicious coffee and breakfast and feel like you have lived in New York for years... then Buvette is the place to go. Buvette is part caf\\u00e9, restaurant, and bar. Buvette is located in the West Village neighborhood in New York. As I was walking to Buvette I had to stop every couple of blocks to just take in the beautiful apartments and houses in the neighborhood.\\n\\nWhat my table ordered:\\n\\n-Almond Croissant\\n-Scone\\n-Croissant\\n-CRQ Monsieur\\n-Steak Tartare\\n-Cappuccino\\n\\nEverything was delicious! I truly enjoyed my breakfast here and I was happy that I chose to come here on my very first day. It set the mood for an amazing day. I will say that due to COVID-19 they have limited seating and they do not have reservations. Make sure to come with plenty of time and with the patience to wait in line for a table. It is definitely worth the wait. Ordered a couple of lemonades, grapefruit juice and a ginger beer as well as one almond croissant (way too overly sweet) and a couple of other small plate items. I'd honestly say this was more of a snack stop for the five of us. Our bill came to a total of $160 and was not worth the price.\\nOur server never came back to check on us, after the food was brought to our table, then there was a switch in servers.\\nFood was not bad, just not something any of us thought was worth the price. To be clear, we were not looking for a cheaper food option, but for this price the food and service was underwhelming.\\nI'm sure lots of folks like this place, it was indeed very crowded, but just not for us. Came here for brunch around 1:30-2 and sat outside. First the waiter was annoyed with us when he asked if we were ready, we said \\\"yes I believe we're ready\\\" and then he walked away rudely and never came back to us. 15-20 mins later we see someone and ask to take our order. We order and our server comes over to confirm. We had some confusion with our drink order and so we said we didn't want the drink (server misunderstood what we meant). Which is completely fine only issue with that was that he told us \\\"future reference don't send something back in a restaurant\\\" ummm excuse us we all work in restaurants and understand the confusion but to talk to a costumer like that was completely unacceptable. 1 star service, food was decent but server left us feeling like we didn't belong there. Delicious coffee and hot coco with house whipped cream!\\nWe only had croissants this time, but sat at the bar where all the orders came though and the food look exceptional! Lovely food, all of it is fantastic. The ambiance was great. I had the steamed eggs with goat cheese. The lattes were delicious. However service was underwhelming- essentially no service. A gentleman brought out food , then the drinks, and no where to be seen until plates were cleared. Overall I will come back and I will hope for a better experience with regards to service. Finally made it to buvette. So long overdue. If you know anything about buvette, it's a very popular spot amongst the famous people and known for their brunch. It did in fact live up to the hype. We went around 4 - so we had to order from the dinner menu. I got the ratatouille tartine, my friend got the croque (ham and cheese essentially), a decaf iced coffee and our other friend ordered \\\"the holiday\\\" cocktail. We were all very pleased with how everything turned out. The ratatouille tartine deserves a lot of praise - the combination of the cheese spread with the vegetables really hit the spot. I cannot wait to come back here Oh, Buvette... where to begin? Before I moved to New York, Buvette always sat at the top of my list of places to dine while visiting the city.\\nSunday brunch is iconic, and it's a must, but if I had to choose, I'd opt for an evening at this charming petite joint above all else. There's just something incredibly alluring about the ambiance of this quintessential french cafe, ideally located in West Village. Whether you sit on the covered patio, at the bar, or at a perfectly tiny table in the corner, you'll surely fall in love with this sweet NYC gem.\\nBeyond the idealistic atmosphere, the food will ignite all the senses just right. Staying on brand with the intimate conditions, the small plates offered at Buvette are exquisite and are sure not to disappoint.\\nAs a vegetarian, my favorite dinner dishes are the TATINE de POTIRON... aghhhh... you might as well die and go to heaven with every flavorful bite. I also recommend the ARTICHAUTS a la GRECQUE, the DAUPHINOIS and the RATATOUILLE, all equally delicious. And for the meat lovers, I am positive you will find your place; After all, it is a French restaurant, and this one certainly doesn't dissatisfy.\\nJouir De! Grate food. We had unforgettable experiences. Staff was friendly and no logging with food. We came here for brunch and were seated right away! Did not have to wait long for the dishes to be ready and each dish was packed with unique flavors. At first I thought it might taste odd to combine all these different dishes into one order, but they each complemented each other fabulously. The food was presented beautifully and despite the small sized plates, filled us up! Amazing food. Tiny tables. Charming service. We went for a weekday breakfast so no wait. Very good meal. Lots of veg options Never expected such delicious French cuisine in the middle of Manhattan. Simple and tasty! \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
